         "body":"<h2>Objective</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to remove internal traffic from your Uberflip Analytics data is to <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039250291\" target=\"_self\">exclude your office IP addresses</a>. However, this doesn't cover remote employees, and excluding their individual IP addresses is usually ineffective because most home internet connections use dynamic IP addresses, which change periodically.</p>\n<p>A better solution for excluding remote internal users is to use their <strong>Visitor IDs</strong> instead. Uberflip Analytics assigns unique Visitor IDs to all visitors to your Hub, so in this article, we'll show you how to identify the Visitor IDs of your internal users, then set up persistent filters that automatically exclude these Visitor IDs across all dashboards.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_f4a19d58-546f-4d83-b663-3e443dd6d15c\">Setup: Enable the <em>Save Dashboard Filters </em>Setting</h2>\n<p>Since you'll be using a dashboard filter to exclude internal Visitor IDs, we strongly recommend that you <strong>turn on the <em>Save Dashboard Filters</em> setting</strong>. When this setting is enabled, any filter you set on one dashboard will be saved and automatically applied to all other dashboards. This ensures that you only need to set up the filter to exclude internal Visitor IDs once, rather than each time you open a dashboard.</p>\n<p>You can find detailed instructions on how to enable the <em>Save Dashboard Filters</em> setting <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040312352\" target=\"_self\">in this article</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 1: Identify an Internal-Only Hub Page</h2>\n<p>Before you can filter based on Visitor IDs, you need to determine which Visitor IDs belong to your internal users. To do that, you can leverage Uberflip Analytics itself: for any page in a Hub, Uberflip Analytics can export a list of Visitor IDs that viewed that page. Therefore, all you need is a Hub page that is not accessible outside your organization, since any Visitor ID that viewed it would by definition belong to an internal user.</p>\n<p>As a result, you first need to <strong>identify a suitable Hub page</strong>, or <strong>create one</strong> if necessary. This page:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Can be <strong>any type of page within a Hub</strong>: a Hub homepage, a Stream page, or an Item page.</li>\n<li>Must be <strong>accessible only to internal users</strong>. This could be:\n<ul>\n<li>A Hub with <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020019192\" target=\"_self\">Hub Authentication</a> or a Stream with <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020069172\" target=\"_self\">Stream Authentication</a> </li>\n<li>A Hub or Stream with the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018840252\" target=\"_self\">No Robots Meta Tag setting</a> enabled, and which has not been shared outside your organization</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029676452\" target=\"_self\">hidden Stream</a> or <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025265112\" target=\"_self\">hidden Item</a> (with No Robots Meta Tag turned on and not shared externally)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Must be<strong> part of a Hub for which you collect Uberflip Analytics data</strong>. This means the page can't be in a Hub where the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040761132\"><em>Prevent Analytics Collection</em> option</a> is enabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your main objective is to capture as many internal Visitor IDs as possible, so the page you choose <strong>should have been viewed by most (or ideally all) of your internal users</strong>. The ideal situation is if you have an internal-only Hub, as this will allow you to collect the Visitor IDs of everyone who viewed <em>any</em> page in that Hub. Regardless of the type of page you choose, we recommend specifically instructing all of your internal users to visit the page to ensure their Visitor IDs are captured.</p>\n<p>When you have identified (or created) the necessary Hub page, proceed to the next step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 2: Export a List of Internal Visitor IDs</h2>\n<p>Using the internal-only Hub page you you identified or set up earlier, you can now get a list of internal Visitor IDs from Uberflip Analytics.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and <strong>go to Uberflip Analytics</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <em>Visitors &gt; Session Overview</em> to open the <strong>Session Overview dashboard</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Filters</strong> at the top of the dashboard to expand the filters menu.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Set a filter</strong> to display<strong> just the internal-only Hub page</strong> you selected:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>For a Hub:</strong> Use <em>Hub </em>| <em>is equal to </em>|<em> [insert name of Hub]</em>. This filter will include visitors to all pages in the selected Hub, and is the best option if you have an internal-only Hub.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For a Stream:</strong> Use <em>Stream Title </em>|<em> is equal to </em>|<em> [insert name of Stream]. </em>This filter will include visitors to the Stream page itself, and any Items in the Stream (even if they did not visit the Stream page).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For an Item: </strong>Use <em>Item Title </em>|<em> is equal to </em>|<em> [insert name of Item]. </em>This filter will include only visitors to the specified Item page.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If needed, <strong>change the <em>View Date</em> filter</strong> to a longer time range to ensure as many Visitor IDs as possible can be captured.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Click on</strong> <strong>Run</strong> to apply the filter.</li>\n<li>In the dashboard, scroll down to the <strong>Session Details</strong> table at the bottom, which displays sessions broken down by Visitor ID (second column from left).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hover your mouse over the table</strong>, then <strong>click on the three-dot (\"meatball\") menu button</strong> that appears in the top right of the table (in the \"Session Details\" title bar).</li>\n<li>In the menu that appears, click on <strong>Download Data</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Download</strong> window will appear. In this window, <strong>change the <em>Limit</em> setting to <em>Custom...</em></strong>, which will automatically default to a setting of 5000 rows:<br> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360055523152/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n<ul>\n<li>We recommend leaving all other options on their default settings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Click on Download</strong>.

However, all users can use the same list of Visitor IDs, so the person who exports the list can simply share it with others so that they don't need to export it themselves.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>If you turned on <em>Save Dashboard Filters</em> as <a href=\"#h_f4a19d58-546f-4d83-b663-3e443dd6d15c\" target=\"_self\">recommended above</a>, you'll only have to do this once.

Any data associated with the listed Visitor IDs will be excluded from all metrics shown on your dashboards.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>Once you've exported the CSV file and copied out the internal Visitor IDs, simply paste them into a TXT file (e.g. with Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac) to easily share them with any other users who need to set up the filter. </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Additional Notes</h2>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics will assign a new Visitor ID to any visitor who is not yet known (does not yet have an Uberflip Analytics cookie). This means that internal visitors will be assigned new Visitor IDs if they clear their browser cache/cookies, use incognito mode, or use a different browser. As a result, you may need to collect a fresh list of internal Visitor IDs and update your filter from time to time.</p>"

For example, if a visitor's Demandbase data indicates that their industry is <em>Financial Services</em>, then the Stream will be filtered to show Items that you have tagged as relating to the financial services industry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order for this functionality to work, you must set up Demandbase <strong>Attribute</strong> <strong>Tags</strong> in your Uberflip account, and add them to all Items in Streams where Demandbase Personalizer is active.

Attribute Tags are specially-formatted tags which you use to indicate to Demandbase Personalizer which content Items should be displayed if a visitor has a given attribute in their Demandbase data.</p>\n<p>To apply an Attribute Tag to an Item, simply add it to the Item in the same way as a normal Item Tag (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\">Use Tags on your Items</a> for instructions)<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">.</a> Attribute Tags use the following structure:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">demandbase.[attribute].[value]</code></p>\n<p>Within this basic format, replace <code class=\"no-padding\">[attribute]</code> with the Demandbase attribute, and <code class=\"no-padding\">[value]</code>with the attribute’s desired value. For example, the tag <code class=\"no-padding\">demandbase.audience.SMB</code> would indicate that the tagged Item should be displayed if a visitor’s audience attribute is \"<em>SMB</em>\", and would therefore be applied to Items relevant to that topic.</p>\n<p>Note that values in tag names must match Demandbase values <strong>exactly</strong>: any spaces, parentheses, etc. that exist in the Demandbase value must also exist in the tag. See <a href=\"#h_4bf79527-0059-4528-9195-ec425bbca904\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Available Demandbase Attributes</strong></a> below for a list of Demandbase attributes and example values.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\">Using the Show Always Tag</h4>\n<p>You can choose to always display certain Items, regardless of the visitor's Demandbase data. To do this, use the <strong>Show Always Tag</strong>:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">demandbase.show</code></p>\n<p>This tag is created automatically when you install Demandbase Personalizer. To use it, simply add it to any Items that you want to always be displayed in Streams where Demandbase Personalizer is active (provided the Item has been added to the Stream). This is useful for content that is relevant to a very wide audience and should be shown to all visitors, as well as to avoid instances where only one or two Items would be shown in the Stream based on Attribute Tags alone.</p>\n<p>If you use the Show Always Tag, keep in mind that the filtered Stream will still respect the Item order set for the full Stream. As a result, we recommend placing Items with the Show Always Tag either at the beginning or end of the Stream (depending on the content).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Do not delete the Show Always Tag from your Uberflip account, even if you don't use it on any Items!

These fields are used to populate the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\" target=\"_self\">Open Graph and Twitter Card tags</a> that social platforms use to generate link previews, and any text you put in them will appear in the preview — including the placeholder text itself, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">{demandbase.company_name}</code> instead of the relevant company name.</li>\n<li>For Marketing and Sales Streams, we recommend enabling the <strong><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\">Banner+Logo template</a></strong> under the Stream's <em>Appearance</em> tab, as this will allow you to use the <a href=\"#h_b000deae-dc03-454b-a70d-e6feae3faacb\" target=\"_self\"><em>Swap Logo</em></a> setting. If you select this template, you should also enable the <strong>Hide Stream Title</strong> option and specify a <strong>Banner Title</strong> (also under the <em>Appearance</em> tab). There are two benefits to doing this:\n<ul>\n<li>If the <a href=\"#h_fda0dc92-8776-4a7d-9223-a364f8d1ca02\" target=\"_self\"><em>Remove Logos When No Match Found</em></a> option is turned on and no logo matches are found, the Banner Title will be shown on the banner instead (rather than an empty banner image).</li>\n<li>If you intend to share the Stream on social media, you can put a placeholder in the Banner Title field (as this isn't shown in the social media preview), but not in the regular Stream Title field (which is shown on social media). In other words, this allows you to personalize the title that a visitor to the Stream sees, without the placeholder text appearing when the same Stream is shared on a social media platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all Streams and Items that you don't plan to share on social media, but which you expect to be indexed by Google, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612892\" target=\"_self\"><strong>SEO Title and SEO Description fields</strong></a>. These allow you to specify alternative titles and descriptions for your Streams and Items when they appear on Google search result pages. You can use these fields to ensure that any placeholders you put in a Stream's or Item's title/description do not appear when that Stream or Item appears on Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If you experience problems with this app's functionality, this may be due to corrupted data. To resolve the issue, try clearing your browser's cache (or try using the app in Incognito Mode to see if that resolves the issue).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>For developers</h2>\n<p>Because this app manipulates a large portion of Stream and Item pages, a race condition can occur, which can cause other JavaScript <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">custom code</a> running on the same page to malfunction. </p>\n<p>If your JS code performs other manipulations on pages where this app is active, you should ensure it runs <strong>after</strong> the app to avoid problems. To help you do this, a <strong>callback functio</strong><strong>n </strong>is built into the app that will be called once the app has finished executing its own code.</p>\n<p>To leverage the callback function, create a function named <code class=\"no-padding\">ufPersonalizerCallback</code> in your own custom code and place your JS inside it. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;<br>var ufPersonalizerCallback = function(){<br> /** Your JS **/<br>};<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>"

This is useful for your prospect nurturing and qualifying process: by setting up Content Attribution on ToFu Items that you associate with high engagement, you can collect data to feed into the lead scoring model in your MAP. This can help you better understand how engaged your prospects are, and when they turn from prospects into qualified leads.</p>\n<p>When you configure an Item with Content Attribution, you specify a field in your MAP, along with a fixed value of your choice. Anytime a known visitor interacts with that Item, Uberflip will write the value you specified to that visitor's MAP profile.</p>\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\n<p>Content Attribution works only for <strong>known visitors</strong>, which are prospects who have previously been profiled in your MAP by submitting a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\" target=\"_self\">Form CTA</a>. Content Attribution will not work with unknown visitors, and it can't attribute past activity to formerly unknown visitors after they are profiled.</p>\n<p>Content Attribution triggers a MAP update when a known visitor <strong>interacts</strong> with an Item on which the feature has been configured. In this context, \"interacts\" is defined as when the visitor has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viewed an Item with Content Attribution, <strong>or</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Submitted a Form CTA placed beside an Item with Content Attribution (i.e. they initially viewed the Item as an unknown visitor, and are now known because they submitted the CTA), <strong>or</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Submitted a Form CTA that links to an Item with Content Attribution (via the Link to Content feature on the Form CTA's \"Success\" page)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>It is possible that a visitor submits a CTA placed beside Item A with Content Attribution, and that CTA also links to Item B with Content Attribution: in other words, the visitor has effectively interacted with two separate Items with Content Attribution at the same time. In this situation, <strong>the Item linked from the Form CTA </strong>(i.e. Item B) will be the one that is tracked in the visitor's MAP profile.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_fcc546be-8759-4aac-aeac-519e145b0275\">Identify the MAP Field to Update</h2>\n<p>Before you set up Content Attribution, you need to decide which field in your MAP should be updated when a prospect interacts with the Item (or create that field, if necessary). To do that, you'll first need to think about <em>how</em> you want to use Content Attribution. Keep in mind that Content Attribution will always write a fixed value to a fixed field, defined per-Item. When you select a field, you can choose if you want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <strong>same field</strong> for all Items on which you enable Content Attribution. Depending on your use case, you could specify different values for each Item, or use the same one for all. Note that, unless you configure your MAP to block updates to this field, it will be updated each time the visitors interacts with a different Item with Content Attribution.</li>\n<li>Use <strong>separate, Item-specific fields</strong> for all Items on which you enable Content Attribution. Again depending on use case, you could use the same value for all Items, or different values per-Item (i.e. if you want the field-value combination for each Item to be unique).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have settled on the best scenario for your use case:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your MAP.</li>\n<li>In your MAP, either <strong>find the appropriate field</strong> or <strong>create it.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>See below for MAP-specific instructions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Once you have found or created the field, get its<strong> name</strong>. This is the name that uniquely identifies that particular field, and is sometimes also known as its \"API name\" (or similar).</li>\n<li>Once you have the name(s) of the field(s) you want to use, you're ready to set up Content Attribution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's how to find the field name in your MAP of choice:</p>\n<div class=\"tabs tabs--colored-1\">\n<div class=\"tabs-menu\">\n<span class=\"tabs-link is-active\">Marketo</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Oracle Eloqua</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Pardot</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">HubSpot</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab\">\n<p>In Marketo, you're looking for the field's <strong>REST API Name</strong>. To get the REST API Name for a given field, you'll need to export a list of fields. For instructions on how to do that, see this article from Marketo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Export+a+List+of+All+Marketo+API+Field+Names\">Marketo: Export a List of All Marketo API Field Names</a></p>\n<p>Once you have downloaded the export, open it, then look under the column <strong>Friendly Label</strong> for the field you want to use.

Instead, simply <strong>scroll down</strong> until you see the field labeled <strong>Internal name</strong>: the value of this field is the field name you'll need.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Enable Content Attribution for an Item</h2>\n<p>You can enable Content Attribution on any Item. Content Attribution settings are Item-specific: the field and value that you specify will be passed only for the particular Item on which you configure them, so you must set up Content Attribution individually for every Item on which you want to use the feature. Content Attribution settings on an Item apply across your Hub, so the configured field/value will be passed regardless of which Stream the Item was when the visitor interacted with it.</p>\n<p>To enable Content Attribution for an Item:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and navigate to the Hub you want to work with.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Content</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the pane on the right, you should be on the <strong>Streams tab</strong>. Here, find any Stream that contains the Item on which you want to configure Content Attribution and <strong>click on it</strong>.\n<ul>\n<li>You can choose any Stream in which the Item appears, including Marketing Streams. The settings you configure will apply to the Item across all Streams in which it appears.</li>\n<li>You cannot do this from the Items tab — you must access the Item from the Streams view.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>While viewing the Stream, locate the Item you want to work with and hover your mouse over the hamburger menu button in the lower left corner of its Item Tile:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360037440112/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>In the menu that appears, click on <strong>Set Integration Item Parameters</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360037440352/Fullscreen_2019-08-30__10_06_AM.png\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-08-30__10_06_AM.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Modify Hidden Fields for Item</strong> window will appear.

         "body":"<hr>\n<p>Did you know that Uberflip automatically protects traffic to your Hub with HTTPS? Here's why that matters, and how it works.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>HTTP vs. HTTPS: A Quick Primer</h2>\n<p>If you've heard that you should be using <strong>HTTPS</strong> but aren't really sure <strong>what it is or why you need it</strong>, this primer is for you. If you're <strong>already familiar with this topic</strong>, you can <a href=\"#h_3a21c173-0f01-4518-946f-bfd92d9ccb89\" target=\"_self\"><strong>skip ahead</strong></a>.</p>\n<h3>What is HTTPS?</h3>\n<p>You've probably heard of HTTP, the <em>HyperText Transfer Protocol</em>. It's a system that web browsers and web servers use to talk to one another; a way for them to send requests (<em>\"send me this webpage\"</em>) and responses (<em>\"here is the webpage you asked for\"</em>) back and forth.</p>\n<p>Most websites don't use HTTP anymore, because it has a major security flaw: it's <strong>not encrypted</strong>. This means that, with HTTP,  anyone who's listening in can see exactly what's being sent back and forth between a browser and a web server. And it's not just three-letter government agencies who can do this: with HTTP, anyone on the open WiFi network at your local coffee shop could see which websites you're looking at.</p>\n<p>HTTPS fixes this problem. The <em>S</em> stands for <strong>secure</strong>, to indicate that all communications over HTTPS are <strong>encrypted</strong>. Only the two parties talking to each other (the browser and the server) can decrypt and read each other's messages — to any eavesdroppers, the encrypted messages just look like garbled nonsense.</p>\n<h3>Why is using HTTPS important?</h3>\n<p>In the past, only websites dealing with \"sensitive\" information (like banks or ecommerce sites) used HTTPS, and HTTP was considered \"good enough\" for everything else. But HTTP has inherent flaws that make it a huge security risk: for example, HTTP does not verify that you're actually connecting to the website you asked for, so there's little to stop an attacker from impersonating a website and stealing your data.</p>\n<p>In recognition of this problem, there has been a push over the last several years to use HTTPS for <strong>all</strong> kinds of websites. If you take a look at your browser's address bar, you should see something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044140311/HTTPS_for_Hubs_Explained___Uberflip_Help.png\" alt=\"HTTPS_for_Hubs_Explained___Uberflip_Help.png\"></p>\n<p>This padlock icon indicates that the website you're on uses HTTPS, and you're likely to see it on most websites you visit. In fact, as of 2019, the majority of the world's websites use HTTPS.</p>\n<p>This push towards HTTPS has been driven in large part by internet giants like Google. Starting in 2014, Google decided to <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html\">prioritize websites that use HTTPS in its search results</a>, effectively downranking sites that use HTTP. And since <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html\">July 2018</a>, Chrome has displayed this message to highlight websites that don't use HTTPS:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360028119571/Example_Domain.png\" alt=\"Example_Domain.png\"></p>\n<p>On today's web, using HTTP is detrimental to your traffic, so you should make sure that all your web properties use HTTPS. The good news is, <strong>using HTTPS with an Uberflip Hub couldn't be easier</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_4a3a60d3-5ddc-45e9-85b0-75555bed064d\" class=\"callout__title\">A Quick Note on Terminology</h4>\n<p>You may have also seen the term <strong>SSL</strong> used in the context of HTTPS. This term refers to the <em>encryption technology</em> that HTTPS uses, and is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \"HTTPS\".</p>\n<p>SSL has actually been replaced by the more-secure <strong>TLS</strong> technology — but although it's technically incorrect, the term \"SSL\" is still widely used. Whenever you see the term \"SSL\" (including in Uberflip's documentation), you can generally assume that this refers to more-secure TLS technology.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_3a21c173-0f01-4518-946f-bfd92d9ccb89\">How does HTTPS work on Uberflip Hubs?</h2>\n<p>If you have set up HTTPS for another website in the past, you already know that it can be a hassle: you have to buy an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), install the certificate on your web server (or, more often, wait for your IT team to do it), and then do it all over again every time the certificate expires.</p>\n<p>You don't need to worry about any of this with your Uberflip Hub. Uberflip <strong>automatically obtains and sets up the SSL certificate</strong> for your Hub's domain, and <strong>automatically renews it when it expires</strong>. This means that you get all the benefits of HTTPS on your Hub, without the hassle of setting it up and maintaining it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Where does Uberflip get the SSL certificate for my Hub?</h2>\n<p>To set up HTTPS for Hubs, we use certificates from <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\"><strong>Let's Encrypt</strong></a>. Let's Encrypt is a new kind of Certificate Authority run by the <a href=\"https://www.abetterinternet.org/\">Internet Security Research Group</a>, a public-benefit corporation backed by a number of major organizations, including Mozilla, Cisco, Shopify, the Ford Foundation, and the EFF. Their mission is to encourage the wider use of HTTPS by making the entire setup and maintenance process much easier. To that end, Let's Encrypt certificates are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Free</strong>: Unlike traditional CAs, Let's Encrypt provides and validates certificates at no cost</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automated</strong>: The entire enrollment process for certificates is automated, as is renewal of the certificate upon expiration</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Open: </strong>Let's Encrypt uses open standards, and their code is open source</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Simple</strong>: With Let's Encrypt certificates, you don't need to worry about payment, installation, or keeping track of expiring certificates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although they're free, Let's Encrypt certificates are <strong>just as secure</strong> as certificates from traditional CAs. And because they're automated, Uberflip can take care of provisioning, setting up and renewing your Let's Encrypt certificates for your Hub domains — you don't need to do a thing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How do I set up HTTPS for my Hub?</h2>\n<h3>New Hubs</h3>\n<p>Whenever you add a new domain to your Hub (under <strong>Hub Options &gt; Change Domain &gt; Add a Domain</strong>), it will be automatically set up to use HTTPS:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360028427372/Hubs___Options_-_Change_Hub_Domain_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Options_-_Change_Hub_Domain_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"492\" height=\"275\"></p>\n<p>Seriously, that's all there is to it. The domain you set up with be secured with HTTPS, and you never need to worry about it again: when it's time to renew the certificate, Uberflip will just seamlessly do it for you.</p>\n<h3>Existing HTTP Hubs</h3>\n<p>If you have an existing Hub that uses HTTP, and you want to <strong>switch to HTTPS</strong>, you can do so with the click of a button.</p>\n<p>To switch, click on your name in the top right corner of the Uberflip app, then go to <strong>Account Settings &gt; Services &gt; Domains</strong>. Find the domain in the list, then <strong>click on the <em>Enable HTTPS </em>button</strong> that appears beside it.</p>\n<p>If a pre-provisioned Let's Encrypt certificate is available for your Hub, this will enable HTTPS on the selected domain immediately. If your Let's Encrypt certificate has not yet been provisioned, HTTPS will be enabled as soon as the certificate is ready, typically within a few hours.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>If your Hub <strong>currently uses HTTP</strong> and you have <strong>embedded Hub content elsewhere</strong> (e.g. using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023374631\" target=\"_self\">Stream Embed</a> or <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020859752\" target=\"_self\">CTA Embed</a> features), <strong>do NOT</strong><strong> proceed</strong>, as this will break your embeds.</p>\n<p>Instead, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">contact Uberflip Support</a> for guidance on what you need to do before making the switch to HTTPS.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What if my Hub already uses HTTPS with a legacy certificate?</h2>\n<h3>Uberflip-Managed Legacy Certificates</h3>\n<p>If you set up HTTPS for your Hub in the past and chose to <strong>let Uberflip handle the certificate setup</strong>, you'll be automatically moved onto a new Let's Encrypt certificate once your current legacy certificate expires. This process is seamless, and you don't need to do anything to make it happen. You shouldn't notice any change, and everything will continue to work just as it did before.</p>\n<h3>Self-Managed Legacy Certificates</h3>\n<p>If you opted to use a <strong>self-managed certificate </strong>with your Hub (i.e. if you sent us a PEM file), you will continue to follow the same process as before: whenever your current certificate expires, you will need to send us a new PEM file.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have also <strong>provisioned a Let's Encrypt certificate for you </strong>as a fallback. If your self-managed certificate expires and you do <strong>not</strong> send us a new PEM file in time, we will automatically transition your Hub onto the Let's Encrypt certificate so that it remains secure.</p>\n<p>If you are currently on a self-managed certificate and want to <strong>switch to a Let's Encrypt certificate</strong>, you can do so at any time. There are a lot of good reasons to switch: you will no longer need to keep track of your certificate expirations, pay for renewals, or prepare and send us a PEM files. If you're interesting in moving from self-managed to automated HTTPS, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\" target=\"_self\">contact our Support Team</a>, or get in touch with your CSM.</p>"

To learn more about Form CTAs and how to set them up, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\">this article</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How Progressive Profiling Works</h2>\n<p>When you set up a Form CTA, one of the options you can enable is <strong>Progressive Profiling</strong>, which allows you to limit how many of the CTA's form fields are displayed to visitors.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works: imagine you need to collect a lot of visitor data, say eight or more distinct pieces of information. To do that, your Form CTA would need the same number of form fields. However, your conversion rate on a CTA with something like eight form fields probably won't be great — not many people are willing to fill out such a long form, and asking for that much at once can feel intrusive and off-putting.</p>\n<p>Progressive Profiling was made for this kind of CTA. If you enable it and set the limit to a more reasonable number (three fields, for example), your conversion rate should improve: now, when a visitor sees this CTA for the first time, they only have to fill in three fields before they can hit the <em>Submit</em> button. As a result, they'll be much more likely to interact with the CTA than if they had to fill in all eight fields.</p>\n<p>But what about the other five fields? Whenever that same visitor sees the same CTA again (for example, gating another piece of content), they'll be shown the next three fields that they hadn't filled out yet.

In this article, we'll explain the nuts and bolts of Hub Search.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What's Hub Search?</h2>\n<p>Did you know your Hub has a search function? Visitors to your Hub can access it by clicking this little magnifying glass in the top right corner of your Hub:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015927051/Content_Experience_Hub___Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Content_Experience_Hub___Uberflip.png\" width=\"702\" height=\"179\"></p>\n<p>...which opens a search box when you click it:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015881832/Content_Experience_Hub___Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Content_Experience_Hub___Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What can Hub Search find?</h2>\n<p>When you enter a search term, Hub Search will search through all <strong>non-hidden Hub Items</strong> in any of the following Stream types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blogs</li>\n<li>Docs</li>\n<li>Videos</li>\n<li>Marketing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It will not search in Sales Streams (because they're hidden) or in Social Streams.</p>\n<p>Hub Search will look for keyword matches in <strong>titles, descriptions and body content</strong> for <strong>Items</strong>, and in <strong>titles and descriptions only</strong> for <strong>Flipbooks</strong>. If you want, you also have the option of looking for matches among <strong>tags</strong>! To learn how to turn this on, check out <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020275651\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How are search results sorted?</h2>\n<p>All Items in the Hub that match the search query are assigned a relevance score. This is built using various factors, including the number of terms matching the search. The search results are then presented by relevance score, with the highest-scoring (most relevant) items at the top.</p>\n<p>In addition, they are also categorized by the type of content, i.e. Blog, Docs, etc. If there are more than five results for a given category, only the top five are shown, along with a <em>Load More</em> button.</p>\n<p>Also, whenever a new Item is added to the Hub, or Items are deleted or modified, the search database will be updated in near-real-time, so subsequent searches will show updated results.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What about Items that are in multiple Streams?</h2>\n<p>Items can appear in multiple Streams, such as Marketing Streams. If an Item is present in more than one non-hidden Stream, it will still only show up in Hub Search results once.</p>\n<p>The way Hub Search decides which version of the Item to show is to re-run the search with the original search terms, but looking for only matches in the titles and descriptions of the <em>Streams</em> that the Item appears in.</p>\n<p>Hub Search will then display the Item in the context of the Stream with the highest relevance score — unless all scores are the same, in which case the Item is shown in its Source Stream (i.e. the Source Blog Stream, Video Stream, etc.). If the Source Stream is hidden, the Marketing Stream with the lowest ID will be used instead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Additional facts about Hub Search</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Recent searches will be stored in the user's browser, so that whenever they search again, their most recently searched terms will be shown. We store a maximum of 5 recent searches.</li>\n<li>The maximum number of results returned for any search query is 100.</li>\n<li>Search queries must be a minimum of three characters long, otherwise no results will be returned.</li>\n</ul>"

When you do this, you keep maintaining the external blog, and Uberflip automatically pulls in new posts (and can even <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022283332\" target=\"_self\">update older posts when you edit them</a>).</p>\n<p>In this article, you'll learn what you need to do when <strong>moving your external blog to another hosting service (i.e. to another CMS, or into Uberflip)</strong>, in order to ensure that your connected Uberflip Blog Stream experiences minimal disruption. Specifically, the migration procedures described in this article are designed to help you:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Avoid <strong>reimporting</strong> existing content into Uberflip (i.e. duplicate content)</li>\n<li>Avoid <strong>broken images </strong>in blog content</li>\n<li>Avoid <strong>broken</strong> <strong>inline links </strong>in blog content</li>\n<li>Ensure the Blog Stream<strong> continues to update automatically</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Option 1: Move an external blog to a different external hosting service</h2>\n<h4>Use this migration procedure if:</h4>\n<p>You are currently hosting your blog on a service outside Uberflip (such as a CMS, or any other type of blog hosting solution), and want to <strong>move the blog</strong> <strong>to another service outside Uberflip</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>This migration procedure assumes that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are only changing the CMS (or other service) that hosts your blog, and that <strong>the blog itself will otherwise remain unchanged</strong>, i.e. it will still have the same name, be available at the same URL, etc.</li>\n<li>Your new CMS has already been set up and is <strong>ready for migration</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01F4Z6G1YZ6AM2RGV4RY8Z7EGP\">Step 1: Pause automatic updates on the Blog Stream</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p><strong>Pause automatic updates </strong>on the Blog Stream that imports content from the blog that you are moving to a new CMS.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Uberflip, go to the <strong>Content</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Click on the Blog Stream that pulls in posts from your current CMS to open it.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Options</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Turn <strong>on</strong> the option <strong>Pause automatic updating of this Stream</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>This will stop the Blog Stream from pulling in further content from the old CMS while you migrate to the new CMS, which helps to avoid creating duplicate content in Uberflip.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Step 2: Set up the RSS feed in the new CMS</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p>Set up the RSS feed in your new CMS on <strong>the same URL </strong>and with <strong>the same GUID format</strong>.</p>\n<p>How you do this will vary depending on your CMS, so you should speak with your CMS administrator. What you need to accomplish is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up the RSS feed in your new CMS on <strong>the exact same URL</strong> as the RSS feed in your old CMS.</li>\n<li>Set up the GUID format for posts in the new CMS's RSS feed to <strong>exactly match the GUID format</strong> used by the old CMS's RSS feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>There are multiple ways to format GUIDs. While the most widely used option is to use the item's <strong>direct URL </strong>as its GUID, another common approach is to use <strong>ID codes</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you use an ID code format for your GUIDs, try to configure your new CMS so that it assigns ID codes to RSS feed items in a way that is <strong>consistent</strong> with the old CMS: for example, if a given blog post had the ID code <em>ABC123</em> in the old CMS, the new CMS should give that same ID code to the same blog post when it assigns GUIDs.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>Your existing Blog Stream is configured to look at a particular RSS feed URL (like <em>https://www.mycompany.com/blog/feed/</em>) for new posts, so by setting up the RSS feed in the new CMS on the exact same URL, you ensure that the Blog Stream can keep pulling in new posts.</p>\n<p>Likewise, GUIDs uniquely identify posts in an RSS feed. Your Blog Stream keeps track of the GUIDs for all of the posts it has imported, and uses these GUIDs to avoid importing the same post more than once. By keeping the formats of the GUIDs the same between the old and new CMS, you ensure that your Blog Stream won't view old posts on your new CMS as \"new\" content and import it (creating duplicates).</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Migrate images</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p>If you are using your old CMS to host the images used in your blog, <strong>migrate the images</strong> to your new CMS, then <strong>find and replace the image URLs</strong> to update them (if needed).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are moving from one CMS to another CMS, there will likely be a built-in process to migrate images from one system to another. Speak with your CMS administrator for details.</li>\n<li>After performing this migration, you will also need to export a<strong> list of image URLs from your old CMS</strong>, and a corresponding <strong>list</strong><strong> of image URLs in your new CMS</strong>, and provide these to your Uberflip representative.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>If you host blog images on your old CMS, those images will no longer be available when you take the old CMS out of service, which results in broken images in your blog posts. To ensure images remain available, you must migrate them to be hosted on the new CMS.</p>\n<p>This migration will allow images to be displayed correctly when the blog is hosted on the new CMS, but will not affect posts that Uberflip previously imported from the old CMS. These posts will still reference the old URLs where the images used to be hosted, and will therefore be broken. To ensure the images in these blog posts are still displayed correctly, the old image URLs must be found and replaced. If you provide a list of old image URLs, and their counterparts in your new CMS, your Uberflip representative can perform this find-and-replace action for you.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Create a new Blog Stream to test the new RSS feed</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p><strong>Add a new Blog Stream</strong> in Uberflip to test the RSS feed in your new CMS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In your Uberflip account, add a new Blog Stream and <strong>specify the RSS feed from the new CMS</strong>.</li>\n<li>Review the Blog Stream to <strong>check that everything looks normal</strong>, i.e. posts look as expected, images are coming in, etc.</li>\n<li>If there are no problems, <strong>archive the Blog Stream</strong> to remove the duplicate content it created from your Hub.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>Creating a new Blog Stream for testing allows you to check that the RSS feed in the new CMS has been configured correctly without affecting the existing Blog Stream. The test Blog Stream will be a duplicate of the existing one, so you can archive it once testing is complete (as it is no longer needed at that point).</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Test importing from the new RSS feed with a limited number of posts</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p>In the new CMS, <strong>limit the number of posts in the RSS feed to a small number</strong>, then <strong>resume automatic updates on the Blog Stream</strong> to test the import.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the RSS feed settings for your blog, set the number of posts to a small number (under 10).</li>\n<li>In Uberflip, resume automatic updates on the connected Blog Stream. To do so, simply follow the instructions in <a href=\"#h_01F4Z6G1YZ6AM2RGV4RY8Z7EGP\" target=\"_self\">Step 1</a> again, and turn <strong>Pause automatic updating of this Stream</strong> back to the <strong>off</strong> setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>Limiting the number of posts in the RSS feed will ensure that only a small amount of posts will be imported into your Uberflip Blog Stream once you resume automatic updates. This helps to minimize the impact in case the GUID formats were not matched correctly, which would cause duplicate content to be imported.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Increase the number of posts in the RSS feed</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p>As a final step, once you have confirmed that no duplicate content is being brought into Uberflip, <strong>increase the number of posts in the RSS feed to the normal amount</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>The maximum number of posts that Uberflip can import from your blog is limited in part by the number of posts included in the blog's RSS feed (up to a maximum of 200). By increasing the number of posts in the RSS feed, you can not only ensure that all new posts are brought in to the Blog Stream, but also that older posts in the Stream can be updated automatically if you modify the corresponding posts in the original blog (as long as the post is still in the RSS feed).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Option 2: Move an external blog into Uberflip</h2>\n<h4>Use this migration procedure if:</h4>\n<p>You are currently hosting your blog on a service outside Uberflip (like a CMS), and want to <strong>host your blog directly in Uberflip</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>This migration procedure assumes that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are <strong>winding down your existing CMS</strong> or other service that currently hosts your blog (or are migrating just the blog off this service while still maintaining it for other uses).</li>\n<li>Your existing CMS is <strong>still online</strong>.</li>\n<li>You will continue to maintain the blog, and want to <strong>use Uberflip's built-in blogging functions</strong> to create <strong>all further posts</strong> on this blog.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01F4Z6G1YZ6AM2RGV4RY8Z7EGP\">Step 1: Pause automatic updates on the Blog Stream</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p><strong>Pause automatic updates </strong>on the Blog Stream that imports content from the blog that you are moving to Uberflip.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Uberflip, go to the <strong>Content</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Click on the Blog Stream that pulls in posts from your current CMS to open it.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Options</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Turn <strong>on</strong> the option <strong>Pause automatic updating of this Stream</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>This will stop the Blog Stream from pulling in further content from the old CMS while you migrate the blog to Uberflip. As you will be blogging in Uberflip, this function is no longer necessary, and turning it off can help to avoid accidentally creating duplicate content.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Migrate images</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p>If you are using your old CMS to host the images used in your blog, <strong>migrate the images</strong> to Uberflip.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To migrate images from your old CMS to Uberflip hosting, <strong>install and use the Image Migrator app</strong>. You can download it from the Uberflip Marketplace <a href=\"https://marketplace.uberflip.com/details/image-migrator/\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039098812\" target=\"_self\">this article</a> for instructions on how to use Image Migrator. Note especially the <strong>requirements</strong> for both your Uberflip account and for images before proceeding.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>If your Uberflip account does not meet the requirements to use Image Migrator (e.g. API access), speak with your Uberflip representative to arrange<strong> temporary access</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>If you host blog images on your CMS, those images will no longer be available when you take the CMS out of service, which results in broken images in your blog posts. To ensure images remain available, you must migrate them to be hosted in Uberflip.</p>\n<p>The Image Migrator app is designed specifically for this purpose. It downloads all of the blog post images from your old CMS and uploads them to Uberflip hosting. Then, it finds image URLs that point to the old CMS in your existing Blog Stream and replaces them with new Uberflip-hosted image URLs to ensure they keep working.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Update inline links</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p><strong>Find-and-replace</strong> <strong>any inline links</strong> in your blog posts that point to the blog's old URL.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Uberflip representative will do this for you: simply <strong>let them know how the URLs of inline links has</strong> <strong>changed</strong>.</li>\n<li>For example, if your blog used to live at the URL <em>https://www.mycompany.com/resources/blog/</em>, and will now live in your Uberflip Hub at <em>https://hub.mycompany.com/blog/</em>, then any link in your old blog posts like <em>www.mycompany.com/resources/blog/example-post </em>would need to be updated to <em>hub.mycompany.com/blog/example-post </em>to keep working.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>When you move your blog from your CMS to Uberflip, this will change the URL where your blog is located (from the URL defined in the CMS to the URL of the Blog Stream). When you take the CMS offline, any links that point to the old URL will be broken. This includes inline links you may have included in old blog posts, i.e. links to other posts in the same blog. To ensure these links keep working, you need to find-and-replace links that point to the old URL so that they point to the new URL instead. As this may involve searching many hundreds of blog posts for affected links, Uberflip is able to automate this action for you.</p>"

For example, if a visitor's Clearbit data indicates that their industry is <em>Financial Services</em>, then the Stream will be filtered to show Items that you have tagged as relating to the financial services industry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order for this functionality to work, you must set up Clearbit <strong>Attribute</strong> <strong>Tags</strong> in your Uberflip account, and add them to all Items in Streams where Clearbit Personalizer is active. See <a href=\"#h_01FH98GSMJA37GMSM1NDE9Y15H\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Using Attribute Tags</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>When <em>Filter Items by Tags</em> is enabled, an Item must have at least one Attribute Tag matching <em>any </em>attribute in the visitor's Clearbit data to be displayed. Items that do not have at least one matching Attribute Tag (or which have no Attribute Tags) will not be displayed.</li>\n<li>If an Item has multiple Attribute Tags, only one of these tags needs to match the visitor's data for that Item to be displayed.</li>\n<li>By default, the minimum number of matching Items that will be displayed is one. If no Items in a Stream have Attribute Tags that match the visitor's Clearbit data, <strong>all</strong> Items in the Stream will be shown (to avoid showing the visitor an empty Stream).<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the <a href=\"#h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Show Always Tag</a> changes this behavior.

For example, if five Items in a Stream are in the order 1-2-3-4-5 and Items 1 and 4 are filtered out, the Stream will still display the remaining Items in the order 2-3-5.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>If you want to use <em>Filter Items by Tags</em>, it's not necessary to tag all the Items in your Hub! To get started, try tagging just the Items in the Streams where this app is enabled.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01FH98GSMJA37GMSM1NDE9Y15H\">Using Attribute Tags</h4>\n<p>To use the <strong><a href=\"#h_01FH95ZQRMZVX0F46Q0CHWJ25D\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Filter Items by Tags</a></strong> functionality, you must add <strong>Attribute Tags</strong> to all Items that appear in Streams where Clearbit Personalizer is enabled. Attribute Tags are specially-formatted tags which you use to indicate to Clearbit Personalizer which content Items should be displayed if a visitor has a given attribute in their Clearbit data.</p>\n<p>To apply an Attribute Tag to an Item, simply add it to the Item in the same way as a normal Item Tag (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\">Use Tags on your Items</a> for instructions)<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">.</a> Attribute Tags use the following structure:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">clearbit.[attribute].[subattribute].[value]</code></p>\n<p>Within this basic format, replace:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[attribute]</code> with the Clearbit main attribute.</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[subattribute]</code> with a Clearbit secondary attribute that belongs to the main attribute chosen, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">city</code>for the main attribute <code class=\"no-padding\">geo</code>.\n<ul>\n<li>If you choose an attribute that does not have a subattribute, simply omit this section, i.e. use the format <code class=\"no-padding\">clearbit.[attribute].[value]</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[value]</code>with the attribute’s desired value. For example, the tag <code class=\"no-padding\">clearbit.geo.city.Chicago</code> would indicate that the tagged Item should be displayed if a visitor’s city attribute in Clearbit is \"Chicago\", and would therefore be applied to Items relevant to that topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that values in the tags must match Clearbit values <strong>exactly</strong>: any spaces, parentheses, etc. that exist in the Clearbit value must also exist in the tag. For a list of Clearbit's main and secondary attributes and values, contact your Clearbit representative.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\">Using the Show Always Tag</h4>\n<p>You can choose to always display certain Items, regardless of the visitor's Clearbit data. To do this, use the <strong>Show Always Tag</strong>:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">clearbit.show</code></p>\n<p>This tag is created automatically when you install Clearbit Personalizer. To use it, simply add it to any Items that you want to always be displayed in Streams where Clearbit Personalizer is active (provided the Item has been added to the Stream). This is useful for content that is relevant to a very wide audience and should be shown to all visitors, as well as to avoid instances where only one or two Items would be shown in the Stream based on Attribute Tags alone.</p>\n<p>If you use the Show Always Tag, keep in mind that the filtered Stream will still respect the Item order set for the full Stream. As a result, we recommend placing Items with the Show Always Tag either at the beginning or end of the Stream (depending on the content).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Do not delete the Show Always Tag from your Uberflip account, even if you don't use it on any Items! Clearbit Personalizer requires this tag to be present to enable key app functionality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>This app filters not just Items on the main Stream page, but also the additional Items displayed when viewing an Item in that Stream. While viewing an Item, the <em>Next/Previous Item</em> area and the <em>Other Content in This Stream</em> carousel will be filtered in the same way as the main Stream page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the carousel, filtered Items will take priority, and any additional free slots in the carousel (after all filtered Items have been displayed) will be filled with non-filtered Items from the same Stream</li>\n<li>If no next or previous filtered Item is available, the <em>Next/Previous Item</em> area will be hidden</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_b000deae-dc03-454b-a70d-e6feae3faacb\">Swap Logo</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> This setting is used to control Clearbit Personalizer's dynamic logo functionality.</p>\n<p>When this setting is turned on, the app will use a visitor's Clearbit data to search Clearbit's Logo API for the logo of the visitor's organization.

We recommend using a generic logo for this purpose (e.g. a logo that just says \"You\" or similar).</p>\n<p>We also recommend specifying a default <em>Banner Title</em> under the <em>Appearance </em>tab to be displayed in case no logo is found and the logos are hidden from the banner. If you do not specify a <em>Banner Title</em>, only a blank header (or <em>Banner Image</em>, if specified) will be shown.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_fda0dc92-8776-4a7d-9223-a364f8d1ca02\">Remove Logos When No Match Found</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> (enabled by default if you have turned on the <a href=\"#h_b000deae-dc03-454b-a70d-e6feae3faacb\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Swap Logo</a> setting).

These fields are used to populate the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\" target=\"_self\">Open Graph and Twitter Card tags</a> that social platforms use to generate link previews, and any text you put in them will appear in the preview — including the placeholder text itself, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">{clearbit.name}</code> instead of the relevant company name.</li>\n<li>For Marketing and Sales Streams, we recommend enabling the <strong><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\">Banner+Logo template</a></strong> under the Stream's <em>Appearance</em> tab, as this will allow you to use the <a href=\"#h_b000deae-dc03-454b-a70d-e6feae3faacb\" target=\"_self\"><em>Swap Logo</em></a> setting. If you select this template, you should also enable the <strong>Hide Stream Title</strong> option and specify a <strong>Banner Title</strong> (also under the <em>Appearance</em> tab). There are two benefits to doing this:\n<ul>\n<li>If the <a href=\"#h_fda0dc92-8776-4a7d-9223-a364f8d1ca02\" target=\"_self\"><em>Remove Logos When No Match Found</em></a> option is turned on and no logo matches are found, the Banner Title will be shown on the banner instead (rather than an empty banner image).</li>\n<li>If you intend to share the Stream on social media, you can put a placeholder in the Banner Title field (as this isn't shown in the social media preview), but not in the regular Stream Title field (which is shown on social media). In other words, this allows you to personalize the title that a visitor to the Stream sees, without the placeholder text appearing when the same Stream is shared on a social media platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all Streams and Items that you don't plan to share on social media, but which you expect to be indexed by Google, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612892\" target=\"_self\"><strong>SEO Title and SEO Description fields</strong></a>. These allow you to specify alternative titles and descriptions for your Streams and Items when they appear on Google search result pages. You can use these fields to ensure that any placeholders you put in a Stream's or Item's title/description do not appear when that Stream or Item appears on Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If you experience problems with this app's functionality, this may be due to corrupted data. To resolve the issue, try clearing your browser's cache (or try using the app in Incognito Mode to see if that resolves the issue).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>For developers</h2>\n<p>Because this app manipulates a large portion of Stream and Item pages, a race condition can occur, which can cause other JavaScript <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">custom code</a> running on the same page to malfunction. </p>\n<p>If your JS code performs other manipulations on pages where this app is active, you should ensure it runs <strong>after</strong> the app to avoid problems. To help you do this, a <strong>callback functio</strong><strong>n </strong>is built into the app that will be called once the app has finished executing its own code.</p>\n<p>To leverage the callback function, create a function named <code class=\"no-padding\">ufPersonalizerCallback</code> in your own custom code and place your JS inside it. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;<br>var ufPersonalizerCallback = function(){<br> /** Your JS **/<br>};<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>"

         "body":"<hr>\n<p>Got a question about Sales Assist? Here are some answers to the most commonly asked questions about Sales Assist.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>When I create my own content Items, how does Sales Assist set the thumbnail image?</h2>\n<p>When you create your own content Item, Sales Assist will look in the metadata of the content to try and find a thumbnail image. If it can find a suitable image, it uses it to create a thumbnail for the Item.</p>\n<p>If there is no suitable image in the metadata, Sales Assist can't create a thumbnail. When that happens, you can simply edit the Item to add an image of your choice (either from a URL, or from Sales Assist's image library).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>I can't add an image to my content Item. What's going wrong?</h2>\n<p>The most common cause of this problem is using a URL that does not point directly to an image file. This usually happens with images you copy from Google Image Search. For example, this URL will display an image, but it's not the actual image URL, so it won't work:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/ZH4t1ZkPNevDmG3v9\">https://images.app.goo.gl/ZH4t1ZkPNevDmG3v9</a></p>\n<p>What you're looking for is a URL that ends with an image file extension, like<em> .jpg</em> or <em>.png</em>. In Chrome, you can get this by right-clicking on an image, then clicking on <em>Copy image address</em>. If you do that on the image in the link above, you'll get this (valid) image URL instead:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uberflip.com/assets/logos/uberflip-logo-white-rubine.png\">https://uberflip.com/assets/logos/uberflip-logo-white-rubine.png</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>If I create a content Item using a link to Google Docs (or Slides, Sheets, etc.), what do I need to do before sharing it with a prospect?</h2>\n<p>To ensure that they can see the content, you need to set up the <em>Share </em>permissions for the Google Doc to give at least your recipient \"Can view\" permission. If you expect the recipient to share the content with others in their organization, you have two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can set the <em>Share</em> permissions for the Google Doc to \"Anyone with the link can view\", which allows the recipient to freely share it with others. If you choose this option, remember that <em>anyone</em> will be able to see the content, so be careful with sensitive content.</li>\n<li>As an alternative, you can also simply leave the permissions set to only your intended recipient initially. When they share the content, additional people who want to view it will be prompted to request permission: these requests will be sent to you, which allows you to capture new potential leads within a sales cycle (as well as retain access control over sensitive content).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>When I create a content Item using a link to Dropbox, why does it show \"View File on Dropbox\" instead of the file itself?</h2>\n<p>Dropbox prevents content that it hosts from being displayed in an iframe, so when you create an Item in Sales Assist using a Dropbox link, it'll always show a \"View File on Dropbox\" message rather than the content itself.</p>\n<p>In general, we recommend using a service other than Dropbox to host files that you want to use with Sales Assist. If you must use Dropbox, the <a href=\"https://marketplace.uberflip.com/details/iframer/\"><strong>iFramer</strong></a> app has a feature that allows content from Dropbox to be iframed. Sales Assist integrates automatically with iFramer, so if you install iFramer and configure it to display Dropbox content, Sales Assist will display Dropbox content as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What happens to notifications that come in while Sales Assist is not open?</h2>\n<p>Sales Assist will display notifications as long as it is open and logged in somewhere in your browser: either in an open tab (even if it's not the active tab), or in the Chrome extension.</p>\n<p>If Sales Assist is not currently logged in and open anywhere, it will hold any notifications that come in and display them the next time the user logs in to Sales Assist. Plus, you can also view past activity notifications in the <em>Shares</em> section of the app.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Why won't the Chrome extension open on some tabs?</h2>\n<p>The Chrome extension is basically an iframe of the Sales Assist app. Some websites, such as LinkedIn, do not allow iframes to be displayed. As a result, the Sales Assist extension won't open whenever the active browser tab is displaying a website that restricts iframes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Why did Sales Assist not notify me when someone viewed a DSR or content Item that I shared with them?</h2>\n<p>Sales Assist can only notify you of views for links generated by Sales Assist. These links contain a special \"share token\" that allows the app to identify when someone visits the linked page. If you simply share the regular DSR or Item URL, this doesn't include the share token, so Sales Assist has no way of knowing (and notifying you) when someone visits the page.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Can I hide certain Items or Streams so that they don't show up in Sales Assist?</h2>\n<p>Sales Assist uses Uberflip's built-in <em>Show in Extensions</em> Stream setting to determine whether or not to surface content in Search: if this setting is turned off for a Stream, Items in that Stream won't be displayed in Sales Assist.</p>\n<p>To turn off this setting for any Stream, open the Stream in Uberflip and click on the <em>Options</em> tab, then toggle the <em>Show in Extensions </em>setting to the off position.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>If an Uberflip Item is set up to redirect the visitor to its canonical URL, will Sales Assist send a notification if a recipient visits that Item?</h2>\n<p>In order to track whether a link was visited and send a notification to the user who shared it, Sales Assist needs the linked page to finish loading. With an Item that redirects to a canonical URL this wouldn't happen, so for these Items, Sales Assist is not able to do tracking and notifications.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>In what order does Sales Assist show Items in the <em>Search</em> section? Can I change the way the search results are ordered?</h2>\n<p>By default, Sales Assist orders content search results (i.e. Items displayed in the <em>Search</em> section) based on how often they've been shared: the more an Item has been shared, the higher up it appears. Share count is determined by the number of Sales and Marketing Streams an Item has been added to, so an Item that has been added to a total of 10 Marketing and/or Sales Streams would rank higher than one that's only in 3 Streams.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can also order search results by publish date (newest first), or alphabetically by title.</p>"

To get started, try tagging just the Items in the Streams where this app is enabled.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01FH9FG4SJ63ZRDPCA2Q6HT29Q\">Using Attribute Tags</h4>\n<p>To use the <strong><a href=\"#h_01FH9FHMZ76SD5783VGP1N1ACN\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Filter Items by Tags</a></strong> functionality, you must add <strong>Attribute Tags</strong> to all Items that appear in Streams where RollWorks Personalizer is enabled. Attribute Tags are specially-formatted tags which you use to indicate to RollWorks Personalizer which content Items should be displayed if a visitor has a given attribute in their RollWorks data.</p>\n<p>To apply an Attribute Tag to an Item, simply add it to the Item in the same way as a normal Item Tag (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\">Use Tags on your Items</a> for instructions)<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">.</a> Attribute Tags use the following structure:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">rollworks.[attribute].[value]</code></p>\n<p>Within this basic format, replace:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[attribute]</code> with the RollWorks attribute, one of:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">company_revenue</code> for the annual revenue (as a general band) of the visitor's company</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">company_size</code> for the number of employees (as a general band) of the visitor's company</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">company_industry</code> for the industry of the visitor's company</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">company_name</code> for the name of the visitor's company</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">domain</code> for the web domain of the visitor's company</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[value]</code>with the attribute’s desired value. For example, the tag <code class=\"no-padding\">rollworks.company_revenue.Small ($1MM-$10MM)</code> would indicate that the tagged Item should be displayed if a visitor’s company revenue falls into the \"Small\" band, and would therefore be applied to Items relevant to that topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that values in tag names must match RollWorks values <strong>exactly</strong>: any spaces, parentheses, etc. that exist in the RollWorks value must also exist in the tag. See <a href=\"#h_0c4d72cb-4bfe-4cc7-a643-74bea841a750\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Available RollWorks attributes</a> below for a list of RollWorks attributes and example values.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\">Using the Show Always Tag</h4>\n<p>You can choose to always display certain Items, regardless of the visitor's RollWorks data. To do this, use the <strong>Show Always Tag</strong>:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">rollworks.show</code></p>\n<p>This tag is created automatically when you install RollWorks Personalizer. To use it, simply add it to any Items that you want to always be displayed in Streams where RollWorks Personalizer is active (provided the Item has been added to the Stream). This is useful for content that is relevant to a very wide audience and should be shown to all visitors, as well as to avoid instances where only one or two Items would be shown in the Stream based on Attribute Tags alone.</p>\n<p>If you use the Show Always Tag, keep in mind that the filtered Stream will still respect the Item order set for the full Stream. As a result, we recommend placing Items with the Show Always Tag either at the beginning or end of the Stream (depending on the content).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Do not delete the Show Always Tag from your Uberflip account, even if you don't use it on any Items!

These fields are used to populate the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\" target=\"_self\">Open Graph and Twitter Card tags</a> that social platforms use to generate link previews, and any text you put in them will appear in the preview — including the placeholder text itself, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">{rollworks.company_name}</code> instead of the relevant company name.</li>\n<li>For Marketing and Sales Streams, we recommend enabling the <strong><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\">Banner+Logo template</a></strong> under the Stream's <em>Appearance</em> tab, as this will allow you to use the <a href=\"#h_3c68ada0-145d-4af1-91b7-b444ec5d1bb9\" target=\"_self\"><em>Swap Logo</em></a> setting. If you select this template, you should also enable the <strong>Hide Stream Title</strong> option and specify a <strong>Banner Title</strong> (also under the <em>Appearance</em> tab). There are two benefits to doing this:\n<ul>\n<li>If the <a href=\"#h_1b875855-b03a-4e40-98f5-d6b4c66e0de5\" target=\"_self\"><em>Remove Logos When No Match Found</em></a> option is turned on and no logo matches are found, the Banner Title will be shown on the banner instead (rather than an empty banner image).</li>\n<li>If you intend to share the Stream on social media, you can put a placeholder in the Banner Title field (as this isn't shown in the social media preview), but not in the regular Stream Title field (which is shown on social media). In other words, this allows you to personalize the title that a visitor to the Stream sees, without the placeholder text appearing when the same Stream is shared on a social media platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all Streams and Items that you don't plan to share on social media, but which you expect to be indexed by Google, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612892\" target=\"_self\"><strong>SEO Title and SEO Description fields</strong></a>. These allow you to specify alternative titles and descriptions for your Streams and Items when they appear on Google search result pages. You can use these fields to ensure that any placeholders you put in a Stream's or Item's title/description do not appear when that Stream or Item appears on Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If you experience problems with this app's functionality, this may be due to corrupted data. To resolve the issue, try clearing your browser's cache (or try using the app in Incognito Mode to see if that resolves the issue).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>For developers</h2>\n<p>Because this app manipulates a large portion of Stream and Item pages, a race condition can occur, which can cause other JavaScript <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">custom code</a> running on the same page to malfunction. </p>\n<p>If your JS code performs other manipulations on pages where this app is active, you should ensure it runs <strong>after</strong> the app to avoid problems. To help you do this, a <strong>callback functio</strong><strong>n </strong>is built into the app that will be called once the app has finished executing its own code.</p>\n<p>To leverage the callback function, create a function named <code class=\"no-padding\">ufPersonalizerCallback</code> in your own custom code and place your JS inside it. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;<br>var ufPersonalizerCallback = function(){<br> /** Your JS **/<br>};<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>"

Once you've created your user, it's also a good idea to share its credentials with your team so that anyone can manage the integration if something goes wrong.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Create a Wistia Stream</h2>\n<p>All you have to do to connect your Hub to Wistia and pull in content from your account is create a new Wistia Stream. Once you have created a Wistia Stream, it will remain connected to the Wistia project you specify during creation, and will continue to pull in any new content you publish there automatically.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>Each Wistia Stream you create will be associated with a particular Wistia project within the connected account.

But if you prefer to use your own SSL certificate, you'll need to send it to us. Here's how.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Before You Begin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To use self-managed SSL with your Hub, you must <strong>own an SSL</strong> <strong>certificate</strong>. If you do not have an SSL certificate, you will need to<strong> purchase one</strong> <strong>from a valid Certificate Authority (CA) vendor</strong> before you can proceed.</li>\n<li>If at all possible, <strong>we strongly recommend using the <em>Let's Encrypt</em> certificate</strong> that is <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028190551\" target=\"_self\">automatically provisioned for your Hub</a>. Doing so has numerous benefits over self-managed certificates, including lower cost (LE certificates are free of charge) and ease of maintenance (Uberflip automatically renews LE certificates for you).</li>\n<li>Although we use the term \"SSL\" throughout this article and elsewhere, this is only out of convention. More properly, any use of the term \"SSL\" in this context should always be taken to mean TLS, which is the technology that is actually used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_150083404321541458362814\">Send Your SSL Certificate to Uberflip</h2>\n<p>Because Uberflip is a SaaS platform, your Hubs and the content on them are delivered from Uberflip's servers — even if visitors are accessing the Hub via your custom domain. This means that Uberflip needs to <strong>install your SSL certificate on our servers</strong>, so you must securely transmit it to Uberflip.</p>\n<h3>Certificate Format</h3>\n<p>You can send the certificate in any valid file format, but we prefer certificates in <strong>PEM format </strong>(i.e. certificate files with a <em>.pem, .crt, .cer,</em> or<em> .key </em>file extension). Since we can directly install PEM format certificates without needing to convert them, sending the certificate in this format allows us to complete the setup process faster.</p>\n<h3>Sending the SSL Certificate Securely</h3>\n<p>Because the SSL certificate is sensitive, you should use a secure method to send it to us. We recommend using a secure file sharing service to create a single-use download link that self-destructs once the file is downloaded. We like to use <a href=\"https://securesha.re/\">Secureshar.re</a>, but if you prefer another service, you are welcome to use that instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Please make sure to include the following when sending your SSL certificate with Uberflip:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>SSL certificate</strong> file: This is the certificate itself, i.e. the PEM file (or similar).</li>\n<li>The <strong>private key</strong>: This is the encryption/decryption key required to use the certificate, and is generally a separate file (if you're not sure where to find your private key, see <a href=\"https://www.digicert.com/blog/where-is-your-private-key/\">this article</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For additional security, we recommend sending these files to Uberflip separately.</p>\n<p>When you have generated secure download links for these files, please email them to <em>support@uberflip.com</em>. As soon as your certificate has been installed and your SSL setup completed, we will notify you by email.</p>"

This feature is included with certain pack types, or may be added on to your Uberflip subscription. For more information, please speak with your Uberflip account representative.</li>\n<li>You will also need your Uberflip account's <strong>API Key and API Secret </strong>as well as its <strong>Account ID</strong>. To learn where to get these details, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019084031\">this article</a>.</li>\n<li>To work with the Image Migrator app,<strong> images you want to migrate</strong> <strong>must meet the following requirements</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>All images must be available on the web through<strong> publicly accessible URLs </strong>(can't be behind a login).</li>\n<li>Every image must have <strong>its own URL </strong>that points directly to the image file (i.e. URLs can't point to non-image files or compressed/zip files of image files).</li>\n<li>All image URLs must be <strong>active</strong> (i.e. successfully loads the image, not a 404 error) at the time of migration. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HE8SMPACC6CT5W4698K2QH0Z\">About Image Migrator</h2>\n<p>The<strong> Image Migrator</strong> app allows you to move blog images in bulk from an external host (e.g. a CMS) into Uberflip.</p>\n<p>When you <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025342851\" target=\"_self\">import an external blog into Uberflip</a>, the Uberflip platform creates an exact copy of the blog using its RSS feed. The problem: images in the blog are represented by the URLs where the images are hosted, and these external image URLs are also copied directly into Uberflip. As a result, all images in the Uberflip copy of the blog will still be loaded from their external URLs, so if those URLs become inaccessible (e.g. because the original blog goes offline), the images will break.</p>\n<p>If you're planning to decommission an external blog that you've imported into Uberflip, <strong>the Image Migrator app helps you to avoid broken images by moving them from the original hosting platform to Uberflip image hosting</strong>. The app automates the entire migration process, including:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Downloading blog images of your choice from their original URLs</li>\n<li>Uploading the images to the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020277571\" target=\"_self\">Uberflip Image Manager</a> in a specified Hub</li>\n<li>Identifying all the Items in that Hub where the images appear</li>\n<li>Replacing the external image URLs in these Items with the equivalent Uberflip-hosted URL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have successfully migrated the images to Uberflip, you can safely shut down the external blog without breaking the images in the Uberflip Blog Stream.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01ECQJ4TT77AKPQ3K268F37YC6\">Configuring the app</h2>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HE8SMPACSJSXS93BVXJNYPTC\" class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>You configure this app at the <strong>Hub level</strong>, which means that your settings will apply only to the Hub you are currently working in. If you have multiple Hubs, you must configure (and use) this app separately in each Hub.</p>\n</div>\n<p>After your Customer Success Manager has installed the Image Migrator app on your Uberflip account, you'll need to start by <strong>configuring it with your Uberflip API credentials</strong>.

Implementing this Insight Tag is <strong>required</strong> to perform any type of conversion tracking with LinkedIn.</span></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_8f4d1581-ad00-48df-8bd1-807c14923c6e\">Prerequisite: Setup Conversion Tracking Campaign in Manager</h2>\n<p>Before you can implement the tracking code on your Uberflip Hub, you'll need to create an <strong>Insight tag, event-specific </strong>tracking method conversion in LinkedIn Campaign Manager. To do so, follow the instructions in this article from LinkedIn:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a425606\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn: Set up Online Conversion tracking</a></p>\n<p>Once you've set up your conversion using the Insight Tag, event-specific method, you should have a copy of its code snippet. It will look something like this:</p>\n<pre><span style=\"background-color: #e9ebed; font-family: monospace, monospace; font-size: 13px; white-space: pre;\">window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: XXXXXXX });</span></pre>\n<p>Your tracking code will have a unique ID after <strong>conversion_id</strong> to associate it to your campaign.</p>\n<p>This is what it will look like in LinkedIn Campaign Manager when you are selecting the conversion method:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/9268874683789/linkedin-conversion-tracking.png\" alt=\"linkedin-conversion-tracking.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Set Up LinkedIn Conversion Tracking on Your Hub</h2>\n<p>Now that you have the tracking code, you can add it to your Hub using <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">custom code</a>. Follow the instructions below to set up the tracking code so that it fires when a Form CTA is submitted.</p>\n<p>Create a code block and name it anything you'd like. For the placement of the code block, select 'Body Bottom'. </p>\n<p>The basis of your code block will be the following:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;<br>window.addEventListener('uberflip.ctaFormSubmitSuccess', (ctaId, ctaData, ctaName) =&gt; {<br>    window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: XXXXXXX });<br>});<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>You'll need to swap out the <strong>conversion_id</strong> with the ID from the conversion campaign you setup in Campaign Manager.</p>\n<p>Now all you have to do is save and enable your code block, and your Linkedin tracking pixel will be deployed on your Hub.</p>\n<h3>Form Specific Conversion Tracking</h3>\n<p>The instructions above would trigger the conversion tracking on <strong>all Form CTA submissions</strong> in a Hub. If you'd like to narrow it down to a specific form, the same steps can be taken but using the following code snippet instead:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;<br>window.addEventListener('uberflip.ctaFormSubmitSuccess', (ctaId, ctaData, ctaName) =&gt; {<br>    if (ctaId.detail.caller.dataset.id == [INSERT FORM CTA ID) {<br>       window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: XXXXXXX });<br>    }<br>});<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>You'll still swap out your <strong>conversion_id</strong> with the ID from your event in LinkedIn Campaign Manager. Where it says <strong>[INSERT FORM CTA ID] </strong>you will include the ID of the Uberflip Form CTA you want to trigger this conversion on. The Form CTA ID can be found in Uberflip by navigating to <strong>Calls-To-Action &gt; Form Calls-To-Action </strong>and finding your CTA. There will be a <strong>CTA ID</strong> column in the table that denotes its unique ID.</p>\n<h3>Item Specific Conversion Tracking</h3>\n<p>If you'd like to trigger the conversion on a specific gated Item in your Hub, the same code snippet for firing on all Form CTAs can be used. The only difference is that you'd create the snippet in an <strong>Item-level code block</strong>. For instructions on setting this up, see the Item-Level Custom Code Blocks section in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this article</a>.</p>"

By default, these tags are only displayed in the Uberflip app, and are not included when an Item is viewed in the Hub's front end. To make these tags available to app like Bombora Personalizer, you must enable the setting <strong>Include Item tags for Custom Code</strong><em>. </em></p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>This setting is Hub-specific, so you must <strong>enable it separately in each Hub</strong> where you want to use Bombora Personalizer.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account and use the <strong>Hubs</strong> menu to select the Hub where you want to enable the setting.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Hub Options &gt; Advanced</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under the section <strong>Content Experience</strong>, check the box next to <strong>Include Item tags for Custom Code</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4410710039693/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The change will be saved automatically, and will take effect immediately.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Configuring the Bombora Personalizer app</h2>\n<p>To use Bombora Personalizer in your Uberflip account, configure the app's settings. These settings control the app's functionality, and how it is applied to your Hubs and Streams.</p>\n<p>You can configure settings for Bombora Personalizer at the <strong>Account Level</strong>, the <strong>Hub Level</strong>, the <strong>Stream Level</strong>, or all three:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any settings you configure at the <strong>Account Level</strong> will apply to <strong>all Hubs</strong> in your account.</li>\n<li>Any settings you configure at the <strong>Hub Level</strong> will apply to <strong>that Hub only</strong>.

The level(s) at which any given setting are available are indicated beside each setting below.</p>\n<p>For instructions on how to access Account, Hub, and Stream Level settings for any Uberflip Marketplace app, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042582411\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Configure settings for Uberflip Marketplace apps</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01F8DX36N57PJ1BA9VG587S4ST\">Enable</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> This setting is used to enable the Bombora Personalizer app for the current Stream.</p>\n<p>When this setting is turned on, the app will be active on the current Stream, using the settings you have defined at the Stream Level. If a setting is not defined at the Stream Level, the app will use the Hub Level settings (if set), or otherwise the Account Level settings (where no Hub Level setting exists).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This setting is only available at the Stream Level, and is turned off for all Streams in all Hubs in your account by default.</li>\n<li>To use the Bombora Personalizer app to personalize a Stream, you must turn on this setting for that Stream individually.</li>\n<li>Until you have turned this setting on for at least one Stream in your account, the Bombora Personalizer app will have no effect on your account (even if the app has been fully configured at the Account and/or Hub Level).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01FH95ZQRMZVX0F46Q0CHWJ25D\">Filter Items by Tags</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> This setting is used to control Bombora Personalizer's dynamic filtering functionality.</p>\n<p>When this setting is turned on, the app will filter the Items in <a href=\"#h_01F8DX36N57PJ1BA9VG587S4ST\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">the specified Stream(s)</a> so that only Items tagged as relevant to the current visitor are displayed. For example, if a visitor's Bombora data indicates that their <em>Predictive Category</em> is set to <em>CRM &amp; Marketing Automation</em>, then the Stream will be filtered to show Items that you have tagged as relating to the CRM &amp; Marketing Automation category.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order for this functionality to work, you must set up Bombora <strong>Attribute</strong> <strong>Tags</strong> in your Uberflip account, and add them to all Items in Streams where Bombora Personalizer is active. See <a href=\"#h_01FH974BGCW2JDEKJTHBSWCQMT\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Using Attribute Tags</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>When <em>Filter Items by Tags</em> is enabled, an Item must have at least one Attribute Tag matching <em>any </em>attribute in the visitor's Bombora data to be displayed. Items that do not have at least one matching Attribute Tag (or which have no Attribute Tags) will not be displayed.</li>\n<li>If an Item has multiple Attribute Tags, only one of these tags needs to match the visitor's data for that Item to be displayed.</li>\n<li>By default, the minimum number of matching Items that will be displayed is one. If no Items in a Stream have Attribute Tags that match the visitor's Bombora data, <strong>all</strong> Items in the Stream will be shown (to avoid showing the visitor an empty Stream).<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the <a href=\"#h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Show Always Tag</a> changes this behavior. If you use the Show Always Tag, then only Items that have the Show Always Tag will be displayed in this situation (rather than all Items in the Stream).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When a Stream is filtered, the order in which the Items are shown will still be the same as in the original (unfiltered) Stream, except with the filtered Items hidden. For example, if five Items in a Stream are in the order 1-2-3-4-5 and Items 1 and 4 are filtered out, the Stream will still display the remaining Items in the order 2-3-5.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>If you want to use <em>Filter Items by Tags</em>, it's not necessary to tag all the Items in your Hub! To get started, try tagging just the Items in the Streams where this app is enabled.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01FH974BGCW2JDEKJTHBSWCQMT\">Using Attribute Tags</h4>\n<p>To use the <strong><a href=\"#h_01FH95ZQRMZVX0F46Q0CHWJ25D\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Filter Items by Tags</a></strong> functionality, you must add <strong>Attribute Tags</strong> to all Items that appear in Streams where Bombora Personalizer is enabled. Attribute Tags are specially-formatted tags which you use to indicate to Bombora Personalizer which content Items should be displayed if a visitor has a given attribute in their Bombora data.</p>\n<p>To apply an Attribute Tag to an Item, simply add it to the Item in the same way as a normal Item Tag (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\">Use Tags on your Items</a> for instructions)<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">.</a> Attribute Tags use the following structure:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">bombora.[attribute].[value]</code></p>\n<p>Within this basic format, replace <code class=\"no-padding\">[attribute]</code> with the Bombora attribute, and <code class=\"no-padding\">[value]</code>with the attribute’s desired value. For example, the tag <code class=\"no-padding\">bombora.pc.Accounting</code> would indicate that the tagged Item should be displayed if a visitor’s Bombora <em>Predictive Category</em> (pc) is set to \"<em>Accounting</em>\" and would therefore be applied to Items relevant to that topic.</p>\n<p>Note that values in tag names must match Bombora values <strong>exactly</strong>: any spaces, parentheses, etc. that exist in the Bombora value must also exist in the tag. See <a href=\"#h_5e1560bd-de49-40d9-a316-2d0da8102379\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Available Bombora Attributes</strong></a> below for a list of Bombora attributes and example values.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\">Using the Show Always Tag</h4>\n<p>You can choose to always display certain Items, regardless of the visitor's Bombora data. To do this, use the <strong>Show Always Tag</strong>:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">bombora.show</code></p>\n<p>This tag is created automatically when you install Bombora Personalizer. To use it, simply add it to any Items that you want to always be displayed in Streams where Bombora Personalizer is active (provided the Item has been added to the Stream). This is useful for content that is relevant to a very wide audience and should be shown to all visitors, as well as to avoid instances where only one or two Items would be shown in the Stream based on Attribute Tags alone.</p>\n<p>If you use the Show Always Tag, keep in mind that the filtered Stream will still respect the Item order set for the full Stream. As a result, we recommend placing Items with the Show Always Tag either at the beginning or end of the Stream (depending on the content).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Do not delete the Show Always Tag from your Uberflip account, even if you don't use it on any Items! Bombora Personalizer requires this tag to be present to enable key app functionality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>This app filters not just Items on the main Stream page, but also the additional Items displayed when viewing an Item in that Stream. While viewing an Item, the <em>Next/Previous Item</em> area and the <em>Other Content in This Stream</em> carousel will be filtered in the same way as the main Stream page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the carousel, filtered Items will take priority, and any additional free slots in the carousel (after all filtered Items have been displayed) will be filled with non-filtered Items from the same Stream</li>\n<li>If no next or previous filtered Item is available, the <em>Next/Previous Item</em> area will be hidden</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_1de240a4-6c3c-42e3-937a-69dedf2776ed\">Swap Logo</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> This setting is used to control Bombora Personalizer's dynamic logo functionality.</p>\n<p>When this setting is turned on, the app will use a visitor's Bombora data to search <a href=\"https://clearbit.com/logo\">Clearbit</a> for the logo of the visitor's organization. If a logo is found, it is automatically inserted into the <em>Prospect Logo</em> space on Marketing/Sales Streams that use the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332\" target=\"_self\"><em>Banner+Logo</em> <em>template</em></a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the setting <a href=\"#h_0bf8cc97-cb9e-49a8-87e4-770931c95098\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Remove Logos When No Match Found</a> to determine what happens if no matching logo can be found.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>For the <strong>Swap Logo</strong> functionality to work, you must enable the <em>Banner+Logo</em> <em>template</em> <strong>and</strong> specify a \"fallback\" <em>Prospect Logo</em> under the <em>Appearance</em> tab on any Marketing or Sales Stream where you want to use this app. The fallback logo will not be displayed if Bombora Personalizer can find a logo for the visitor, but this feature will not activate if no logo is set. We recommend using a generic logo for this purpose (e.g. a logo that just says \"You\" or similar).</p>\n<p>We also recommend specifying a default <em>Banner Title</em> under the <em>Appearance </em>tab to be displayed in case no logo is found and the logos are hidden from the banner. If you do not specify a <em>Banner Title</em>, only a blank header (or <em>Banner Image</em>, if specified) will be shown.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_0bf8cc97-cb9e-49a8-87e4-770931c95098\">Remove Logos When No Match Found</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> (enabled by default if you have turned on the <a href=\"#h_1de240a4-6c3c-42e3-937a-69dedf2776ed\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Swap Logo</a> setting).

These fields are used to populate the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\" target=\"_self\">Open Graph and Twitter Card tags</a> that social platforms use to generate link previews, and any text you put in them will appear in the preview — including the placeholder text itself, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">{bombora.ind}</code> instead of the relevant industry.</li>\n<li>For Marketing and Sales Streams, we recommend enabling the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\"><strong>Banner+Logo template</strong></a> under the Stream's <em>Appearance</em> tab, as this will allow you to use the <a href=\"#h_1de240a4-6c3c-42e3-937a-69dedf2776ed\" target=\"_self\"><em>Swap Logo</em></a> setting. If you select this template, you should also enable the <strong>Hide Stream Title</strong> option and specify a <strong>Banner Title</strong> (also under the <em>Appearance</em> tab). There are two benefits to doing this:\n<ul>\n<li>If the <a href=\"#h_0bf8cc97-cb9e-49a8-87e4-770931c95098\" target=\"_self\"><em>Remove Logos When No Match Found</em></a> option is turned on and no logo matches are found, the Banner Title will be shown on the banner instead (rather than an empty banner image).</li>\n<li>If you intend to share the Stream on social media, you can put a placeholder in the Banner Title field (as this isn't shown in the social media preview), but not in the regular Stream Title field (which is shown on social media). In other words, this allows you to personalize the title that a visitor to the Stream sees, without the placeholder text appearing when the same Stream is shared on a social media platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all Streams and Items that you don't plan to share on social media, but which you expect to be indexed by Google, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612892\" target=\"_self\"><strong>SEO Title and SEO Description fields</strong></a>. These allow you to specify alternative titles and descriptions for your Streams and Items when they appear on Google search result pages. You can use these fields to ensure that any placeholders you put in a Stream's or Item's title/description do not appear when that Stream or Item appears on Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If you experience problems with this app's functionality, this may be due to corrupted data. To resolve the issue, try clearing your browser's cache (or try using the app in Incognito Mode to see if that resolves the issue).</li>\n<li>If you have custom code in your Hub that isn't working properly when using the Bombora app, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\" target=\"_self\">reach out to Uberflip onBrand support</a>. They can help get this fixed for you. </li>\n</ul>"

If you're not sure whether your plan includes API access, please contact your Brightcove representative for help.</li>\n<li>You can only connect your Hub to one Brightcove instance at a time (a Brightcove instance may contain multiple accounts, but they must all be accessible under the same login credentials).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About the Brightcove Integration</h2>\n<p>Brightcove Video Cloud is a video hosting platform. If you're already hosting your video content on Brightcove, you can easily make it part of your content experiences by bringing it into your Hub with our Brightcove integration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_efca44e5-cfad-4c34-a33b-680b83acd4e1\">Prerequisite: Get Your Brightcove API Credentials</h2>\n<p>To pull your Brightcove videos into your Hub, Uberflip will access your account using the Brightcove API. To do this, we will need <strong>API credentials</strong>. You can get these from your Brightcove account, and use them to give third party services access to your account without having to share your login credentials.</p>\n<p>Specifically, you will need to get the following credentials from your Brightcove account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Account Number</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Client ID</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Client Secret</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 1: Get Your Account Number</h3>\n<p>The first thing you'll need is your Brightcove account number, which is also referred to as your <strong>Account ID</strong>. It is readily available your Brightcove account. For detailed instructions on where to find it, see <strong>Steps 1 and 2</strong> in this article from Brightcove:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-account-information.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brightcove: Get Client Credentials</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Step 2: Get Your Client ID and Client Secret</h3>\n<p>To get your <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>, you'll need to <strong>register a</strong> <strong>client</strong> in Brightcove. In this context, Uberflip is the \"client\", and registering a client for Uberflip effectively creates a special kind of user in your Brightcove account. Uberflip's integration will use this client to access your Brightcove account and pull your videos into your Hub.</p>\n<p>As with a regular user in your account, you will choose which permissions the client will have within your account. At the end of the setup process, Brightcove will generate a <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong> for the newly created client, which are essentially analogous to a username and password. You will use these to set up the integration in Uberflip.</p>\n<p>You can find detailed instructions on how to register a client in this article from Brightcove:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://apis.support.brightcove.com/general/managing-api-authentication-credentials.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brightcove: Creating client registrations</a></strong></p>\n<p>As you follow the steps in that article, keep the following notes in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 4: </strong>You can choose any name and description you like, but for ease of use in the future, we recommend indicating that this is the client you use for the Uberflip integration.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 5: </strong>Make sure you select all of the accounts that contain videos you want to bring into your Hub.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 6: </strong>The only permissions you need to grant to the client are <strong>CMS &gt; </strong><strong>Playlist Read</strong> and <strong>CMS &gt;</strong> <strong>Video</strong> <strong>Read</strong>, as well as <strong>Players &gt;</strong> <strong>Read</strong>. Ensure that the boxes next to these three permissions are checked. You can leave all other permissions unchecked.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 8: </strong>In this step, you'll get the <strong>Client ID and Client Secret</strong> that you'll need to proceed. Make sure you copy these and paste them somewhere where you can easily retrieve them in a moment (for example, a text editor like Notepad/TextEdit). As soon as you click on the <strong>Okay, I copied it</strong> button, these details will no longer be accessible — if you didn't copy them, would have to generate new ones by creating a new client registration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you have your <strong>Account Number</strong>, <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>, proceed below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Create a Brightcove Stream</h2>\n<p>All you have to do to connect your Hub to Brightcove and pull in your videos is create a new Brightcove Stream. Once you have created a Brightcove Stream, it will remain connected to your Brightcove account, and will continue to pull in any new content you publish there automatically.</p>\n<p>Each Brightcove Stream you create will pull in videos from one playlist within one Brightcove player. You can pull in videos from multiple Brightcove playlists by simply creating multiple Brightcove Streams in your Hub.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and navigate to the Hub where you want to add the Brightcove Stream.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu, click <strong>Content</strong>\n</li>\n<li>On the<strong> Content</strong>, you'll be on the <em><strong>Streams</strong></em> tab.

You can usually obtain this information from your IT department.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HRDBCVA2KFZ905RG6QHKMQ6H\">About IP Address Exclusion</h2>\n<p>In most organizations, it's common for internal users to spend a lot of time browsing their own Hubs: aside from Marketing reviewing the content they create, Sales and Success teams will also routinely browse for content to share.</p>\n<p>The problem is, all of this internal traffic throws off your metrics: your internal users tend to have different browsing habits from your external visitors, which can <strong>skew the data and make your metrics unreliable</strong>. To avoid this, you should set up Uberflip Analytics to filter out your organization's own IP addresses, which will exclude any data generated by internal visitors.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HRDBCVA2GETGG3MV8JY6WY98\" class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>Do you <strong>work from home</strong>? Don't forget to <strong>add your own home IP address</strong> (and those of any coworkers who also work remotely) to your list of exclusions. (If you're not sure what your home IP address, simply Google \"what is my IP?\".)</p>\n<p>If you do this, keep in mind that most home IP addresses aren't static, and may change from time to time.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HRDBCVA2C3N99B79KXJ9C78K\">Exclude Specific IP Addresses from Uberflip Analytics</h2>\n<p>You can specify any individual IP address or range of IP addresses to be excluded. The specified IP addresses must be <strong>IPv4</strong> (IPv6 addresses are not supported), and can be added as <strong>single IP addresses</strong>, <strong>IP ranges</strong>, or <strong>CIDRs</strong>.</p>\n<p>Any exclusions you specify will apply to both Uberflip Analytics <strong>and</strong> legacy Metrics. The exclusion rules work differently for each system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>In Uberflip Analytics</strong>: IP address filters will be applied to future data only. Filters are <strong>non-destructive</strong> (filtered data is hidden, not deleted).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>In legacy Metrics</strong>: IP address filters are applied <strong>only</strong> to future data, i.e. after an exclusion is added. Any previously collected data relating to an excluded IP address will not be removed from your existing metrics. Filters are <strong>destructive</strong> (filtered data is deleted, and not recoverable).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To exclude IP addresses from Uberflip Analytics (and legacy Metrics):</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and click on <strong>Analytics</strong> in the top menu.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Analytics Settings</strong>, then click on <strong>Exclude IP Addresses</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360048495771\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"244\" height=\"157\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Exclude IP Addresses</strong> menu will appear on the right. Use the <strong>IP Addresses</strong> text box to type in any IP address(es) that you want to exclude from Uberflip Analytics data.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>See the help text above the text box for accepted formats.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360048373892\" alt=\"Excluded_IP_Addresses_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When you are finished, click on <strong>Save</strong>. Your settings will take effect immediately.</li>\n<li>If you later want to remove an IP address exclusion (i.e. to stop filtering out traffic for a certain IP address/range), simply <strong>remove it from the list</strong>, then click on <strong>Save</strong> again.\n<ul>\n<li>For <strong>Uberflip Analytics</strong>: Data for previously filtered IP addresses will be visible again, including for the period when the exclusion was in effect.</li>\n<li>For <strong>legacy Metrics</strong>: Data for previously filtered IP addresses will only be visible for the period after the exclusion was removed (and before the exclusion was added). Data for the period when the exclusion was in effect was not collected, and is not available.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HRDBCVA2W2VPAVWQRFWBB36S\">Excluded Visitors Dashboard</h2>\n<p>Because Uberflip Analytics filters out data for excluded IP addresses without destroying it, this data is still collected and remains available. The <strong>Excluded Visitors</strong> dashboard, which is located below the <em>Exclude IP Addresses</em> menu, displays metrics for <strong>only the IP addresses specified in your exclusion list</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360048374572\" alt=\"Excluded_IP_Addresses_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>This dashboard essentially shows the effects of the exclusion rules you have set up. As a result, it's useful for <strong>testing if the exclusions you have configured are having the intended effect</strong>.</p>"

If you're not sure whether your plan includes API access, please contact your Vidyard representative for help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About the Vidyard Integration</h2>\n<p>Vidyard is a video hosting platform specifically tailored to Marketing and Sales use cases. If you're already hosting your video content on Vidyard, you can easily make it part of your content experiences by bringing it into your Hub with our Vidyard integration.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Vidyard plans with a limited number of embeds</h4>\n<p>This integration <strong>embeds</strong> videos from your Vidyard account into pages on your Uberflip Hub. Some Vidyard plans have a <strong>limit on the number of videos that you can embed</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you are on this type of plan, you must ensure that any Vidyard videos that you bring into your Hub are <strong>set to be embeddable in Vidyard</strong>, otherwise visitors will encounter an error when trying to view them.</p>\n<p>For more information and instructions, see this article from Vidyard:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://knowledge.vidyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033244534\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\"><strong>Vidyard: Why is my video no longer available at its embedded location?</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_efca44e5-cfad-4c34-a33b-680b83acd4e1\">Prerequisite: Get Your Vidyard API Token</h2>\n<p>To pull your Vidyard players into your Hub, Uberflip will access your Vidyard account using the Vidyard API. To do that, we'll need an <strong>API token</strong>. You use API tokens to give third party services access to your Vidyard account without needing to share your login credentials.</p>\n<p>In Vidyard, API tokens are specific to a <strong>sub-group </strong>and the players it contains. Vidyard controls access to a sub-group using <strong>roles</strong>, and each role has its own API token. You can use any default or custom role's API token with Uberflip, provided that the role has the <strong>View Organizations Assets</strong> permission enabled. If you would like to simply use a default system role's API token, choose the token belonging to the <strong>User</strong> role.</p>\n<p>Once you have chosen the role you want to use, simply <strong>copy its API token </strong>in Vidyard.</p>\n<p>To learn where you can find and copy the API token you'll need, see this article from Vidyard:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://knowledge.vidyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009875814-Access-your-Vidyard-API-tokens\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Vidyard: Access your Vidyard API tokens</strong></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Create a Vidyard Stream</h2>\n<p>All you have to do to connect your Uberflip account to Vidyard and pull in all available players is create a new Vidyard Stream. Once you have created a Vidyard Stream, it will remain connected to your Vidyard account, and will continue to pull in any new content you publish there automatically.</p>\n<p>Each time you create a new Vidyard Stream in your Hub, you'll be asked to enter an API token. This means you can create separate Vidyard Streams with different API tokens, for example if you need to import players from multiple Vidyard sub-groups.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note: Vidyard player and Video Structure</h4>\n<p>Vidyard organizes video content in the following way: <em>Parent group &gt; sub-group &gt; player &gt; individual videos</em>. In other words, a Parent group can contain multiple sub-groups, and each sub-group can contain multiple players, which in turn can contain multiple videos.</p>\n<p>Uberflip imports <strong>all players from a specified sub-group</strong>. Note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API tokens are specific to a single sub-group, so adding a new Stream <strong>will only import players from the sub-group associated with the API token</strong> you provided. You would need to add additional Streams to import players in other sub-groups (using separate API tokens).</li>\n<li>Uberflip will create <strong>one Item per player</strong>. If a player contains multiple videos, they will all be contained within the one Item representing that player.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and navigate to the Hub where you want to add the Vidyard Stream</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu, click <strong>Content</strong>\n</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Streams</strong> tab of the Content page, click the <strong>New Stream</strong> button<br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/8690833526925/abcd.png\" alt=\"abcd.png\"></span>\n</li>\n<li>In the modal that opens, select <strong>Vidyard</strong> in the <em>Source Streams</em> list<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/12918299957901\" alt=\"mceclip0.png\" width=\"401\" height=\"403\">\n</li>\n<li>You'll now see the <strong>Add a Vidyard Stream</strong> window.

When it's done, you'll see a confirmation message. To view the Items that were created for these players, click <strong>View Stream</strong> </li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's it! Your Vidyard content has been imported into your Hub, and is now available to be included in the content experiences you create.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>Does your Vidyard account contain a lot of players? By default, Vidyard Streams will pull in a <strong>maximum of 50 players</strong>.

To learn more about Uberflip Analytics and how to use it, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035433571\" target=\"_self\">this article</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Data Collection Start Dates</h2>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics is powered by a proprietary event collection system. As visitors browse Uberflip Hubs, this system records a variety of events related to their behavior. The collected data is then fed into Uberflip Analytics, where it is used to calculate the metrics that are displayed.</p>\n<p>When it was originally launched, the event collection system was able to collect a limited number of data points, and we have since implemented the collection of additional data points on an ongoing basis. As a result, the various data points collected by the system have <strong>distinct start dates</strong> on which Uberflip Analytics began to collect the relevant data. In practice, this means that different metrics in Uberflip Analytics have varying amounts of historical data available, so you can view data further back in time on some metrics than on others.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Uberflip Analytics Data Collection Start Dates</h2>\n<p>The table below displays the start dates on which Uberflip Analytics first began to collect data for each category of metrics that it records:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>Start Date</em> column indicates the <strong>first full month</strong> in which data was collected. In some cases, data for part of the previous month may also be available, but would represent an incomplete view of that month.</li>\n<li>Where applicable, the <em>Notes </em>column lists any exceptions to the start date indicated, or any other related issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<table style=\"height: 1183px;\" width=\"688\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 22px;\">\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 218px;

These are collections of data visualizations (\"widgets\") that focus on particular areas of interest, such as how visitors are reaching your Hubs, or how your Form CTAs are performing.</p>\n<p>In addition to the general <strong>Home</strong> dashboard, UFA offers a variety of more granular and specialized dashboards. These are grouped into four <strong>categories </strong>based on the type of data they focus on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Traffic</strong>: Where your visitors are coming from</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content</strong>: How content and content experiences are performing</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Calls-To-Action</strong>: How your CTAs are performing</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Visitors</strong>: How visitors are behaving once they are in your Hubs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These categories are shown as sections the sidebar menu: <strong>click on any category</strong><strong> to expand it</strong> and navigate to the dashboards inside.</p>\n<p>All dashboards can be <strong>filtered</strong>, and you can <strong>export data</strong> from dashboards — we'll look at these actions in more detail below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0H8EE9NFX55PPFR60\">Reports</h3>\n<p>Where dashboards visualize data to make it more easily digestible, <strong>reports</strong> display the underlying <strong>raw data</strong> in table form. Reports are more comprehensive than dashboards, allowing you to dive into the data in much greater detail.</p>\n<p>UFA features a number of built-in reports. To view them, <strong>click on the <em>Standard Reports</em> section</strong> in the sidebar to expand it.</p>\n<p>Like dashboards, reports also allow for <strong>filtering </strong>and <strong>data exports</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z003YYASJ6MGN0PHH0\" class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>Because they can contain a large amount of data, it's normal for reports to take a little longer to load than dashboards.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0EY3ATX89ACFXX2Z7\">Settings</h3>\n<p>Use UFA's settings to customize it to your organization's needs. See these articles for more details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039250291\" target=\"_self\">Exclude Traffic From Specific IP Addresses in Uberflip Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039658671\" target=\"_self\">Set Persistent Filters in Uberflip Analytics</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0VDZAJAAPMXAMKM1C\">Basic Uberflip Analytics features</h2>\n<p>While viewing dashboards and reports in UFA, you can <strong>refresh the data </strong>at any time, as well as <strong>learn how specific data points are defined or calculated.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0QS7TVY6G5XTPRAJZ\">Refresh data</h3>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics <strong>automatically displays the most up-to-date data</strong> available. Here's how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you open a dashboard, the <strong>most recent available</strong> data will be displayed. In most cases this will initially be <strong>cached data</strong> from the last time a refresh occurred. You can see how recent the cached data is in the top right corner:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043188591\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>As part of loading a dashboard, Uberflip Analytics also <strong>checks if more recent</strong> <strong>data</strong> is available. If there is more recent data, this is <strong>compared to the cached data</strong>. If this comparison finds a difference, Uberflip Analytics will <strong>automatically start loading the latest data </strong>into the dashboard widget. This is indicated by a <strong>loading spinner </strong>that appears in the top right corner of each widget:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043295011\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-11-18__12_11_PM.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Once the <strong>latest data is being displayed across all widgets</strong>, the timestamp in the top right corner of the page will display \"<em>just now</em>\" to reflect this:<strong><br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043254092\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"></strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition to the automatic check that happens when you load a dashboard, you can also <strong>force a check for more recent data</strong>. To do so, simply <strong>click the <em>Run</em> button</strong>. You can do this at any time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is <strong>no difference</strong> between the cached data and the more recently collected data, <strong>the dashboard will not update even if you force a refresh</strong> (by clicking the <em>Run</em> button). In this case, the timestamp in the top right corner will continue to reflect the last time the data was updated (i.e. the last time there was a change).</li>\n<li>Unlike dashboards,<strong> reports</strong> will <strong>always</strong> <strong>pull in the latest data </strong>when they are loaded, and never display cached data.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0NQCQAVBZ9EEN2DGB\" class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>Currently, Uberflip Analytics takes approx. 1 hour to process and make collected data available, so the latest data is always a <strong>minimum of 1 hour old</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1ZR7JEG6YNE61AB4Y\">Learn more about data points and visualizations</h3>\n<p>To learn more about how a data point is defined, or how a visualization works, use the built-in <strong>tooltip functionality</strong>. Throughout Uberflip Analytics, you can find tooltips in two places:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Visualizations</strong>: Dashboard visualizations where a tooltip is available have a small <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043293451\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"> icon beside their title. Hover your mouse over this icon to view a tooltip that explains what the visualization shows:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043250292\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-11-18__11_55_AM.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tables</strong>: Anywhere you see a table (such as in some dashboard widgets and all reports), hover your mouse over a table header to see a definition of that data point:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043254352\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-11-18__12_47_PM.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also find more <strong>in-depth information about UFA's available data points</strong> in the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008893132-Data-dictionary\">data dictionary section</a> of Uberflip Help.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z154G49VDBMF2PS7RX\">Advanced Uberflip Analytics features</h2>\n<p>UFA also features various advanced functions that allow you to <strong>filter data </strong>in various ways; <strong>drill in to dashboards </strong>for additional detail; <strong>download, send, and schedule dashboards</strong>, and <strong>create custom reports</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1V7QS51FQ43QKJPER\" class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics date ranges use a <em><strong>from-until (before)</strong></em> format. This means that the data included in that date range ends at 11:59pm on the day before the final day selected.<br><strong><br>Example:</strong> A date range of 01/01/2022 - 07/01/2022, will return data from 01/01/2022 at 12:00am until 06/01/2022 at 11:59pm. </p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1J7HNF81C7WHC96TY\">Filtering data</h3>\n<p>Every dashboard and report in Uberflip Analytics has a set of built-in filters. Use these filters to <strong>narrow down the data displayed in the visualizations</strong> in various ways, for example by timeframe, Hub, tags, etc.</p>\n<p>Filters are available on all dashboards and reports, and are shown in a panel at the top:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043443751\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Some filters are universal and appear on all dashboards/reports (such as <em>View Date</em>), while other are contextual, and are determined by the data in the dashboard or report.</p>\n<p>To learn how to set filters in UFA, see this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055716132\">Filter data in Uberflip Analytics</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1MGB2SJEW0CPJS6GY\">Drill into dashboards</h3>\n<p>You can drill into dashboards to <strong>view additional or contextual data.</strong> There are two ways to drill in UFA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Visualization drill:</strong> You can drill into the underlying data for any dashboard visualization, such as large number or chart widgets.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stream and Item drill: </strong>In dashboard tables that display Streams or Items, you can drill into an individual Stream or Item to see more data about it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn how to use UFA's data drilling features, see this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055716312\">Drill into Uberflip Analytics dashboards to view more data</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1H93GWXX606BTTNH1\">Download and send dashboards and reports</h3>\n<p>UFA can <strong>package and send dashboards </strong>so that you and others can view or use the dashboard data outside of the Uberflip Analytics interface. In UFA, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download full dashboards in <strong>PDF</strong> or <strong>CSV</strong> format</li>\n<li>Send dashboard data to various destinations <strong>on demand</strong> or <strong>on a schedule</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These features are especially useful for keeping stakeholders in your organization who don't typically use Uberflip up to date on your KPIs.</p>\n<p>To learn how to download, send, and schedule dashboards, see this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055717012\">Download and send Uberflip Analytics dashboards and reports</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1F8TMATDXFETETQ0Q\">Create custom reports (requires a compatible pack type or module)</h3>\n<p>If you're on Uberflip's Enterprise pack type, or you have added the Attribution module to your Uberflip subscription, you can use <em>UFA Explore</em> to dive into the raw data and <strong>create your own custom reports</strong>.</p>\n<p>To learn more about this powerful feature and how to use it, see this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051891272\" target=\"_self\">Create custom reports in Uberflip Analytics with Explore</a></li>\n</ul>"

For help with that, see the <a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/\">Optimizely Knowledge Base</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About the Optimizely Integration</h2>\n<p>Optimizely is an experimentation platform that allows you optimize your digital experiences by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B testing</a> different configurations. If you have an Optimizely account, you can integrate it with your Hub to test things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which titles and headlines drive more content click-throughs?</li>\n<li>Which CTA colors drive more engagement?</li>\n<li>What kind of copy works better for your CTAs — direct or playful?</li>\n<li>Are certain types of images more effective than others?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about the Optimizely platform and what it can do, see <a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com/\">the Optimizely website</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Prerequisite: Create and Configure an Optimizely Web Project</h2>\n<p>Optimizely integrates with your Hub using a small piece of code called a <strong>snippet</strong>. Optimizely organizes your experiments into <strong>Web Projects</strong>, each of which have their own snippet. Uberflip grabs this snippet from Optimizely automatically: all you have to do is tell us the unique Project ID of the Web Project you want to use with your Hub.</p>\n<p>As a result, before you can set up the integration in Uberflip, there are three things you need to do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new Web Project for your Hub</li>\n<li>Change a setting so that the Web Project's snippet will work with your Hub</li>\n<li>Get the Web Project's <em>Project ID</em>, which Uberflip will use to grab the snippet from Optimizely and deploy it on your Hub</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Step 1: Create a Web Project</h3>\n<p>To integrate your Hub with Optimizely, you'll need to <strong>set up a new Web Project</strong> <strong>in Optimizely</strong> that is specifically dedicated to running tests on your Hub. We don't have any special requirements for this project: with one exception (see the next step) you can name it and set it up in any way you like.</p>\n<p>You can find instructions on how to create a new Web Project in this article from Optimizely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/Set_Up_Optimizely/Manage_projects_in_Optimizely_X_Web#Create_a_new_project\">Manage projects in Optimizely X Web - Create a new project</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 2: Change the Project's jQuery Setting</h3>\n<p>Once your new Web Project has been set up, you need to <strong>adjust the jQuery</strong> setting for the project's snippet. Specifically, under <strong>Settings &gt;jQuery Inclusion</strong>, you need to make sure the setting for your Uberflip Hub project is set to <strong>Do not include jQuery in project code (recommended)</strong>.</p>\n<p>For instructions on how to find and change this setting, see this article from Optimizely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/Set_Up_Optimizely/Project_Settings%3A_jQuery_and_Project_JavaScript_settings_in_Optimizely_X#jQuery_settings\">Project Settings: jQuery and Project JavaScript settings in Optimizely X - jQuery settings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_ace252b6-7574-4100-abb8-f03ed8b6078f\">Step 3: Get your Optimizely Project ID</h3>\n<p>With your new Web Project set up and configured correctly, the only thing you still need to set up the integration with your Hub is the Web Project's <strong>Project ID</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Project ID in Optimizely is part of the Web Project's snippet: the Project ID is <strong>the number right before \".js\" in the snippet URL</strong> in Optimizely.</p>\n<p>For instructions on how where to find the snippet (and its URL and Project ID), see this article from Optimizely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/Set_Up_Optimizely/Implement_the_one-line_snippet_for_Optimizely_X#2._Retrieve_the_snippet\">Implement the one-line snippet for Optimizely X - Retrieve the snippet</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Connect Your Hub to Optimizely</h2>\n<p>Now all you need to do is integrate your Hub with Optimizely by connecting them via the Hub menu.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account and select the Hub on which you want to create an integration.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Integrations</strong>.<br> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018402791/Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>On the right, you'll see a list of services that Uberflip can integrate with. Find <strong>Optimizely</strong> in the list, then click on its <strong>Connect</strong> button on the right (under the <strong>Action</strong> column) to set up the integration:<br> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024072672/Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"606\" height=\"51\">\n</li>\n<li>A pop-up window will appear. <strong>Enter <a href=\"#h_ace252b6-7574-4100-abb8-f03ed8b6078f\" target=\"_self\">the Project ID you obtained earlier</a></strong> into the field provided:<br> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024072732/Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"473\" height=\"310\">\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Connect</strong>. You'll see a confirmation message that you're connected to the select Web Project:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024092711/Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"461\" height=\"214\">\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Close</strong>, and you will be returned to the to the <strong>Integrations</strong> page in your Hub, where you'll now see the Project ID listed next to Optimizely.</li>\n<li>That's it! The selected Optimizely Web Project is deployed on your Hub. You can now start running experiments on your Hub by configuring the Web Project in Optimizely.</li>\n</ol>"

But figuring out how well your efforts actually match your visitors' profiles and interests can be difficult. To help you take a data-driven approach to understanding of your audience, Uberflip has partnered with Bombora to integrate their demographic, firmographic and intent data directly into your Hub.</p>\n<p>The Bombora integration powers the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022410952\">Visitor Insights dashboard</a> in Uberflip, which you can use to gauge the relevance of your content experiences to your visitors, and to guide your content development process. In addition, Bombora is also one of the components that feeds into <a href=\"https://www.uberflip.com/ai/\">Uberflip AI</a>. This is the technology that powers the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022410572\">Content Recommendations</a> and <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022595791\">Site Engager</a> features, so integrating your Hub with Bombora allows you to take advantage of Uberflip AI to personalize recommendations for your visitors.</p>\n<p>The data Bombora provides is aggregated from billions of data points per month, drawn from a deep network of data sources called the <a href=\"https://bombora.com/data/bombora-data-co-op/\">B2B Data Cooperative</a> (Data Co-op). Integrating your Hub with Bombora makes it part of the Data Co-op, giving you access to this massive pooled data set while also contributing to it. You can find more information about Bombora and how it collects data <a href=\"https://bombora.com/data/\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">What is intent data?</h4>\n<p>Intent data is information about topics visitors are interested in, focused on keywords and behavior that suggest the <em>intent</em> to make a purchase related to those topics. Bombora generates this data by observing user browsing behavior and content consumption across their network, then using machine learning to analyze keywords and identify the topics of each visited page. Given enough data, this allows Bombora to build a profile of a given visitor's interests, and to infer their intent to make a purchase.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Connect Bombora to Your Hub</h2>\n<p>All you need to do to integrate your Hub with Bombora is to connect them via the Hub menu.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account and select the Hub on which you want to create an integration.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Integrations</strong>.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018402791/Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>On the right, you'll see a list of services that Uberflip can integrate with.

Items are account-wide, so any Item in your Uberflip account can be used in any Hub under that account.</p>\n<p>To use an Item that lives in one Hub in a different Hub, you'll need to use a <strong>Marketing Stream</strong> in the destination Hub (the Hub where you want to use the Item). Either create a new Marketing Stream, or use an existing one.</p>\n<p>Open up the Marketing Stream (in the destination Hub) by going to <em>Content &gt; Streams tab </em>and clicking on the Stream. While viewing the Marketing Stream, click on the <strong>Manage Items</strong> button in the menu bar:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360038927352/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>The <strong>Update Marketing Stream</strong> menu will appear in a pop-up window.

Click on it to select it, then click on <strong>Update</strong> to add it to the Marketing Stream. There you have it: the Item from Hub A is now in a Stream in Hub B.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>Keep in mind that <strong>CTA placements are Hub-specific</strong>, so Item-related placements (i.e. Gate or Show Beside) will <strong>not</strong> carry over when the Item is used in a different Hub.</p>\n<p>For example, if you gate an Item with a CTA in Hub A, and then also use that Item in Hub B, the Item <strong>will not be gated in Hub B</strong> — you would need to set up the CTA gate separately for Hub B.</p>\n</div>"

Within your Hubs, <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\">Form CTAs</a> are a highly effective way to generate leads — <a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/blog/gating-content-this-one-small-change-will-7x-your-conversion-rate\">over 7x more effective than traditional landing pages</a>. And once you've generated those leads, you need to do something with them — which is where Marketing Automation Platforms (MAPs) like Pardot shine.</p>\n<p>Form CTAs are designed to stream the leads they capture to a MAP, where you can make them part of your lead nurturing strategy. With Pardot specifically, you have the option of adding these leads to your main Prospect List, or to a Pardot List of your choice.</p>\n<p>When you integrate your account with Pardot, Uberflip also automatically assigns unique IDs (using cookies) to all visitors to your Hub. This has two effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a visitor fills out a Form CTA that is connected to Pardot, the data they enter is tied to their cookie's ID. This allows us to automatically prefill that visitor's data on any other Form CTAs that they interact with.</li>\n<li>Even if a user has not yet filled out a Form CTA, the cookie allows them to be tracked as they engage with your Hub content. If you set up the necessary custom fields in Pardot, this allows you to track the Items that leads convert on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this article, we'll look at the prerequisites for integrating your account with Pardot, how to configure the integration, and optional steps to enable additional data collection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_948614204271547759391585\">Prerequisite: Get your Pardot login credentials</h2>\n<p>To set up a Pardot integration, you will need the following information:</p>\n<dl class=\"dl-horizontal\">\n<dt>Salesforce login credentials</dt>\n<dd>The email address and password associated with the Salesforce SSO account that you want to use. See the <a href=\"#h_01EXFSFM2Q1HX37428486ZR557\" target=\"_self\">guidelines on choosing an account</a> to use with the integration below.</dd>\n<dt>Pardot Account ID</dt>\n<dd>A unique ID that identifies your Pardot Instance.

You will need the <strong>login credentials</strong> for this account, which are simply its <strong>email address and password</strong>.</p>\n<p>Before selecting which account you want to use for this purpose, please note the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a best practice, you should <strong>not</strong> use an account that is associated with a specific user. If you do, the integration can stop working if that user leaves your company, changes their email or password, or their account is deactivated.</li>\n<li>We recommend that you <strong>create a new account specifically for the Uberflip integration</strong>.

In addition, you can also choose to turn on <strong>options which send additional data to Pardot</strong>. This data can help you to understand how your leads are engaging with your content in Uberflip.</p>\n<p>The options you can configure are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Set Lead Sources: </strong>If enabled, Uberflip will record the specific CTA(s) a lead submitted on their profile — both the first CTA they ever submitted, and the one they submitted most recently.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Flipbook Tracking: </strong>If enabled, Uberflip will record a lead's Flipbook page views on their profile.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content Counters: </strong>If enabled, Uberflip will record counts of how many times a lead has viewed different types of content (e.g. articles, videos, etc.) on their profile.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HA398Y626W41CGAA6EKVC8FX\" class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>Most of these options use <strong>custom fields </strong>(<a href=\"#h_01EXHKV1TNS277T568WCA25F7T\" target=\"_self\">see below</a>) to record the relevant data. The exception is the the <strong>Set Lead Sources</strong> option: when this is enabled, Uberflip will update Pardot's <strong>default <em>Source</em> field</strong> on the lead profile. This will happen <strong>only if the <em>Source</em> field is empty</strong> — if it already has a value, Uberflip will not change it.</p>\n</div>\n<p>These settings are disabled by default, and the integration will still work if you choose not to enable them. However, we highly recommend turning them on.</p>\n<p><strong>To configure these options:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the <strong>Connected Services</strong> page, click on the <strong>Edit </strong>button that now appears next to Pardot in the list (under the <strong>Action </strong>column):<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/19400909526925\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Edit Settings</strong> window will open.

However, the integration will also send data for which Pardot does not have standard fields. To capture this data, you need to <strong>create custom fields in Pardot</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about Uberflip-created custom fields and how they're used in this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040307932\">Uberflip custom fields for Marketing Automation Platforms explained</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To create custom fields:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the <strong>Connected Services</strong> page, click on the <strong>Fields </strong>button next to Pardot (under the <strong>Action </strong>column):<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/19400950563213\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Service Fields</strong> window will open. Inside, you'll see a list of all the custom fields that you can set up in Pardot to record the data being sent from Uberflip. By default none of these fields will exist yet — fields that still need to be created appear in red and are indicated by an <strong>x</strong> in their <strong>Status</strong> column:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018997551\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"572\" height=\"265\">\n</li>\n<li>To create a field, click on the <strong>+Add</strong> button beside it:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/19400950566285\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Once a field has been successfully created, its line will turn grey, the <strong>+Add</strong> button will disappear, and a checkmark will appear beside it in the <strong>Status</strong> column:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/19400909535245\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"704\" height=\"67\">\n</li>\n<li>Continue clicking the <strong>+Add </strong>button for each field until you have added all the fields you want to use, then close the Service Fields window when you're finished.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_122448172301547497456083\" class=\"callout__title\">Required vs. optional fields: what's the difference?</h4>\n<p><strong>Required </strong><strong>fields</strong> are either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fields that Uberflip will try to write to, but which don't exist in Pardot by default, or</li>\n<li>Fields which are associated with the <strong>Set Lead Sources/</strong><strong>Flipbook Tracking/</strong><strong>Content Counters </strong>options. <a href=\"#h_1907883961871547850435749\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">These options</a> require custom fields, so if you enable them, you must also create the corresponding fields. Note that if you do not enable these options, their fields will not appear in the Service Fields window.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Optional </strong><strong>fields</strong> are related to tracking the Item a lead converted on. These are optional because, if you do not create them, the corresponding data will still be sent to Pardot, but will simply not be recorded. Adding these optional fields will allow you to capture potentially valuable insights on which Items are your best performers in terms of conversions, so we strongly recommend adding them.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA398Y622X1MG1MHG4V03EPQ\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>Congratulations — you've successfully integrated Pardot, and your Uberflip account is now ready to start sending data to Pardot.

Items that you've added to Sales or Marketing Streams are always \"reflections\" of the original Item that was created in its source Stream (for example, a Blog Stream, or a Flipbooks Stream). This means that if you make any changes to the Item in its source Stream, those changes will also be reflected in any Sales or Marketing Stream which that Item appears in. This also applies if you delete the Item in its Source Stream, which will simultaneously delete it from any Sales or Marketing Streams, as well.</p>"

Within your Hubs, <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\">Form CTAs</a> are a highly effective way to generate leads — <a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/blog/gating-content-this-one-small-change-will-7x-your-conversion-rate\">over 7x more effective than traditional landing pages</a>. And once you've generated those leads, you need to do something with them — which is where Marketing Automation Platforms (MAPs) like HubSpot shine.</p>\n<p>Form CTAs are designed to stream the leads they capture to a MAP, where you can make them part of your lead nurturing strategy. With HubSpot specifically, you have the option of adding these leads to your main contacts list, or to a Smart List of your choice.</p>\n<p>When you integrate your account with HubSpot, we also automatically assign all visitors unique IDs (using cookies). This has two effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a visitor fills out a Form CTA that is connected to HubSpot, the data they enter is tied to their cookie's ID. This allows us to automatically prefill that visitor's data on any other Form CTAs that they interact with.</li>\n<li>Even if a user has not yet filled out a Form CTA, the cookie allows them to be tracked as they engage with your Hub content. If you set up the necessary custom fields in Hubspot, this allows you to track the Items that leads convert on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this article, we'll look at how to configure your account to integrate with HubSpot, along with optional steps to enable additional data collection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA5KARSM88R482B0XGD1XACG\">Connect Your Account to HubSpot</h2>\n<p>All you need to do to integrate your Uberflip account with HubSpot is to connect them via the Uberflip app.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log into Uberflip and select any Hub</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu, click <strong>Integrations</strong><br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/19433365207181\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>You'll see a list of services that Uberflip can integrate with.

Enabling Flipbook Tracking and Content Counters will allow you to track visitor behavior within your Hubs, and link it to specific contacts in HubSpot.

You'll also notice that some of the fields are marked as <strong>Required</strong> and some as <strong>Optional</strong> under the <strong>Necessity</strong> column:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Required</strong> fields are associated with either <strong>Flipbook Tracking</strong> or <strong>Content Counters</strong> and will only appear if you enabled these features in step 2 above.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Optional</strong> fields are related to tracking the Item a lead converted on; see t<a href=\"#h_122448172301547497456083\">he note below</a> for more details.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To be able to record data in a given field, you must first create it in HubSpot.

What's the difference?</p>\n<p><strong>Required</strong> <strong>fields</strong> are fields which are associated with the <strong>Flipbook Tracking/</strong><strong>Content Counters </strong>options. These options require custom fields, so if you enable them, you must also create the corresponding fields. Note that if you do not <a href=\"#h_926635265141547850518532\">enable these options</a>, their fields will not appear in the Service Fields window.</p>\n<p><strong>Optional</strong> <strong>fields</strong> are related to tracking the Item a lead converted on. These are optional because, if you do not create them, the corresponding data will still be sent to HubSpot, but will simply not be recorded. Adding these optional fields will allow you to capture potentially valuable insights on which Items are your best performers in terms of conversions, so we strongly recommend adding them.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA5KARSN8Z5KNXCJ73BNHKGJ\">Next Steps</h2>\n<p>You're all set: you've successfully integrated your Uberflip account with HubSpot.

To learn how to set this up, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026830272\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p>Another option is to use a task automation tool, such as Zapier, Microsoft Flow, automate.io, etc. These tools are designed to connect different software platforms, and to automatically perform an action whenever a specified trigger event occurs. While we can't provide detailed instructions for each such tool, a general setup might look like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a Form CTA placed on your Uberflip blog to collect subscriber emails.</li>\n<li>Use emails collected with this Form CTA to populate a mailing list in your email marketing tool.</li>\n<li>Set up the task automation tool to monitor your blog's RSS feed (i.e. the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052074531\">RSS feed of your Uberflip Blog Stream</a>) for new posts.</li>\n<li>Configure the task automation tool to send a new email each time a new post is published in that RSS feed, using your email marketing tool and the mailing list generated for this purpose (i.e. the one created using the Form CTA).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With this setup, your visitors can effectively subscribe to your blog by entering their email into the Form CTA, then receive an email notification whenever you publish a new post.

         "body":"<h2>Question</h2>\n<p>When I try to share content on social media or other websites, the thumbnail is not fully showing — it looks cut off. Why is this happening?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>When you share content from your Hub on the web, the service you're sharing on will look at the shared content's <a href=\"http://ogp.me/\">Open Graph (OG) tags</a> to determine what to display in the preview. In most cases, the thumbnail for the preview will be taken from the <code class=\"no-padding\">og:image</code> tag. Uberflip automatically populates the <code class=\"no-padding\">og:image</code> tag with an image based on what's being shared: for example, if you share an Item, the Item's thumbnail will be used. (For more information about how this works, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\">this article</a>).</p>\n<p>Many websites and other services expect the the <code class=\"no-padding\">og:image</code> tag to contain a rectangular image, typically with an aspect ratio of around 1.9:1 (or sometimes 2:1). For example, <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/best-practices/\">1.9:1 is what Facebook recommends</a>. As a result, if the image from your Hub (e.g. the Item thumbnail) is taller than this, it will be cropped down to 1.9:1 when shared, and will appear cut off.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there's currently no way to override the default image and use a custom image for the <code class=\"no-padding\">og:image</code> tag. If you encounter this issue, you can resolve it by ensuring your Hub's images are as close as possible to a 1.9:1 ratio. You can also check out <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020030752\">this article</a> to see what image dimensions we generally recommend for your Hub.</p>"

         "body":"<h2>Question</h2>\n<p>I have created a Blog Stream in Uberflip by importing an RSS feed from my existing blog. If I now delete the original blog, what happens to the Blog Stream?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>When you import a blog into your Hub with RSS, Uberflip pulls in existing posts on that blog to create content Items in the Blog Stream. These Items are created <em>from</em> the original blog's posts, but are completely separate and no longer tied to them after creation. As a result, deleting the original blog will <strong>not</strong> cause the corresponding Items to be deleted from the Blog Stream.</p>\n<p>However, importing a blog with RSS also automatically brings in any associated images (post thumbnails and body images). Rather than importing and hosting these images, Uberflip displays them by linking to their location in the original blog. Deleting the original blog <strong>will also delete the images</strong>, which means that <strong>they will no longer be displayed</strong> in your Blog Stream.</p>\n<p>If you have imported a blog into your Hub with RSS and want to delete the original blog, you will need to migrate the images to Uberflip. To do that, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">contact us</a> for help.</p>"

         "body":"<h2>Question</h2>\n<p>I imported posts from a blog into a Blog Stream using RSS. If I make a change to a post in the original blog, will the corresponding Item in Uberflip be updated as well?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>In general, yes: if you import a blog post into Uberflip and then subsequently edit that post in the source blog, the post in Uberflip will also be updated automatically. For this to happen, the following conditions must be met:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>\n<strong>The blog Item must not be edited in Uberflip</strong>: as soon as any changes are made to an imported blog Item in Uberflip, it is considered distinct from the original blog post, and the link between them is severed permanently. (However, <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045488551\">there are some things you can change without breaking the connection</a>.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The original blog post must still be available in the RSS feed</strong>: once the original blog post drops off the RSS feed, we are no longer able to query it for updates.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The original blog post must be within the most recent 200 items in the RSS feed</strong>: even if the original blog post is still in the RSS feed, Uberflip will only check the most recent 200 items for updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This applies only to <strong>modifying</strong> the original post: if you <strong>delete</strong> (rather than change) the original blog post, the imported Item will <strong>not </strong>be deleted, and will remain in Uberflip.</p>\n<p>Finally, note that <strong>not all changes to the original blog post will trigger an update in Uberflip</strong>. See the <a href=\"#h_01F7YJC2HDS4F38WRWPNK2KGFS\" target=\"_self\">Technical details section</a> for specifics.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">What about other types of Items?</h4>\n<p>The same principle applies to Items in all other types of Source Streams as well, e.g. Video, Social, and Docs (except Flipbooks): in general, modifying the source content will modify the imported Item in Uberflip, <strong>unless</strong> it has been modified in Uberflip first.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01F7YJC2HDS4F38WRWPNK2KGFS\">Technical details</h2>\n<p>If you're interested in the technical nuts and bolts behind this answer, here's how the process works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you import a blog post via RSS, Uberflip takes the unique identifier of the post (the <em>GUID</em>) and saves it to the <em>External ID </em>field of the corresponding Uberflip Item. This shared identifier is what links the original blog post with the Uberflip Item.</li>\n<li>Every 1-2 hours (approx.), Uberflip runs an automation that checks the RSS feed connected to a Blog Stream for updates. In addition to looking for new posts in the feed, the automation also checks if any posts in the feed have the same GUID as an Item in the connected Blog Stream in Uberflip.</li>\n<li>For any post and Item pair with matching GUIDs, the automation then looks at the <em>&lt;title&gt;, &lt;content:encoded&gt;</em>, and <em>&lt;pubDate&gt;</em> fields for that post in the RSS feed. If the values in any of these fields are different from the corresponding values on the Uberflip Item, the automation assumes that the blog post must have been updated since the Uberflip Item was created or last updated. In such cases, Uberflip reimports the updated blog post and updates the Item's corresponding values to match.</li>\n<li>If you make any changes to an Uberflip Item that was imported from an RSS feed, Uberflip will remove that Item's original GUID from the <em>External ID</em> field, and replace it with a different GUID to indicate that the Uberflip Item is now distinct from the original blog post. This why Items that have been modified in Uberflip aren't updated if their original blog post is changed: because the post and Item no longer have matching GUIDs, the automation doesn't consider the blog post in the RSS feed to be the same as the Uberflip Item.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">RSS feed changes that will <strong>not</strong> trigger an Uberflip Item update</h4>\n<p>The automation will only check the <em>&lt;title&gt;, &lt;content:encoded&gt;</em>, and <em>&lt;pubDate&gt; </em>fields in the RSS field for updates.</p>\n<p>The other fields that are present on each post in the RSS feed (i.e. <em>&lt;link&gt;</em>, <em>&lt;description&gt;</em><em>, &lt;author&gt;</em>, <em>&lt;dc:date&gt;</em>, and <em>&lt;category&gt;</em>) are ignored for this purpose, and therefore updating these fields will <strong>not </strong>cause the Uberflip item to be updated (unless any of the <em>&lt;title&gt;, &lt;content:encoded&gt;</em>, and <em>&lt;pubDate&gt; </em>fields is <strong>also</strong> updated at the same time).</p>\n</div>"

How can I ensure the video has sound when the video is playing? </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"14\">All major browsers now automatically mute videos that autoplay. For example, see <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes\" target=\"_self\">this article from Google</a>, which explains how this policy works in Chrome.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"14\">Because this is a policy that’s enforced by the visitor’s browser, there is no way to force videos to autoplay with sound. If you want videos to autoplay, the visitor must manually unmute them.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"14\">However, browsers will not mute a video that does <strong>not</strong> autoplay (i.e. videos that the visitor cooses to play). As a result, you can <strong>disable autoplay</strong> to ensure that your videos play with sound enabled.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"14\">In Uberflip, you can disable autoplay on any video Source Stream (i.e. YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, Vidyard or Brightcove). This is a Stream-level setting, so it will apply to all videos in the Stream, including when the videos are placed in Marketing or Sales Streams.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"14\">Here's how to disable autoplay for a video Stream:</p>\n<ol>\n<li data-renderer-start-pos=\"14\">Under <strong>Content</strong>, find and open the video Source Stream (not a Marketing or Sales Stream).</li>\n<li data-renderer-start-pos=\"14\">Click on the <strong>Options tab</strong>.</li>\n<li data-renderer-start-pos=\"14\">Find the setting <strong>Disable auto playback</strong>:<br>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"237\"><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360066747571/mceclip0.png\" alt=\"mceclip0.png\"></p>\n</li>\n<li data-renderer-start-pos=\"14\">Turn this setting <strong>ON</strong> (green position). The change will save automatically, and will take effect right away.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember that this is a per-Stream setting, so you must <strong>configure it separately for each video source Stream</strong> in your Hub. Repeat the steps above for each Source Stream where you want to disable video autoplay.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"237\"> </p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"237\"> </p>"
